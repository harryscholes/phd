abstract = {ubiquitin-binding proteins play an important role in eukaryotes by translating differently linked polyubiquitin chains into proper cellular responses. current knowledge about ubiquitin-binding proteins and ubiquitin linkage-selective interactions is mostly based on case-by-case studies. We have recently reported a method called ubiquitin interactor affinity enrichment–mass spectrometry (ubIa-Ms), which enables comprehensive identification of ubiquitin interactors for all ubiquitin linkages from crude cell lysates. one major strength of ubIa-Ms is the fact that ubiquitin interactors are enriched from crude cell lysates, in which proteins are present at endogenous levels, contain biologically relevant post-translational modifications (ptMs) and are assembled in native protein complexes. In addition, ubIa-Ms uses chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, which mimics native diubiquitin and is inert to cleavage by endogenous deubiquitinases (DuBs). Here, we present a detailed protocol for ubIa-Ms that proceeds in five stages: (i) chemical synthesis of ubiquitin precursors and click chemistry for the generation of biotinylated nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin baits, (ii) in vitro affinity purification of ubiquitin interactors, (iii) on-bead interactor digestion, (iv) liquid chromatography (lc)–Ms/Ms analysis and (v) data analysis to identify differentially enriched proteins. the computational analysis tools are freely available as an open-source r software package, including a graphical interface. typically, ubIa-Ms allows the identification of dozens to hundreds of ubiquitin interactors from any type of cell lysate, and can be used to study cell type or stimulus-dependent ubiquitin interactions. the nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin synthesis can be completed in 3 weeks, followed by ubiquitin interactor enrichment and identification, which can be completed within another 2 weeks.},

abstract = {Quantitative proteomics by mass spectrometry is widely used in biomarker research and basic biology research for investigation of phenotype level cellular events. Despite the wide application, the methodology for statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins has not been unified. Various methods such as t test, linear model and mixed effect models are used to define changes in proteomics experiments. However, none of these methods consider the specific structure of MS-data. Choices between methods, often originally developed for other types of data, are based on compromises between features such as statistical power, general applicability and user friendliness. Furthermore, whether to include proteins identified with one peptide in statistical analysis of differential protein expression varies between studies. Here we present DEqMS, a robust statistical method developed specifically for differential protein expression analysis in mass spectrometry data. In all data sets investigated there is a clear dependence of variance on the number of PSMs or peptides used for protein quantification. DEqMS takes this feature into account when assessing differential protein expression. This allows for a more accurate data-dependent estimation of protein variance and inclusion of single peptide identifications without increasing false discoveries. The method was tested in several data sets including E. coli proteome spike-in data, using both label-free and TMT-labeled quantification. Compared with previous statistical methods used in quantitative proteomics, DEqMS showed consistently better accuracy in detecting altered protein levels compared with other statistical methods in both label-free and labeled quantitative proteomics data. DEqMS is available as an R package in Bioconductor.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the Functional Catalogue (FunCat), a hierarchically structured, organism-independent, flexible and scalable controlled classification system enabling the functional description of proteins from any organism. FunCat has been applied for the manual annotation of prokaryotes, fungi, plants and animals. We describe how FunCat is implemented as a highly efficient and robust tool for the manual and automatic annotation of genomic sequences. Owing to its hierarchical architecture, FunCat has also proved to be useful for many subsequent downstream bioinformatic applications. This is illustrated by the analysis of large-scale experiments from various investigations in transcriptomics and proteomics, where FunCat was used to project experimental data into functional units, as 'gold standard' for functional classification method, and also served to compare the significance of different experimental methods. Over the last decade, the FunCat has been established as a robust and stable annotation scheme that offers both, meaningful and manageable functional classification as well as ease of perception. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The biogenic amine transporters (BATs) regulate endogenous neurotransmitter concentrations and are targets for a broad range of therapeutic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Because eukaryotic BATs are recalcitrant to crystallographic analysis, our understanding of the mechanism of these inhibitors and antidepressants is limited. LeuT is a bacterial homologue of BATs and has proven to be a valuable paradigm for understanding relationships between their structure and function. However, because only approximately 25{\%} of the amino acid sequence of LeuT is in common with that of BATs, and as LeuT is a promiscuous amino acid transporter, it does not recapitulate the pharmacological properties of BATs. Indeed, SSRIs and TCAs bind in the extracellular vestibule of LeuT and act as non-competitive inhibitors of transport. By contrast, multiple studies demonstrate that both TCAs and SSRIs are competitive inhibitors for eukaryotic BATs and bind to the primary binding pocket. Here we engineered LeuT to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by mutating key residues around the primary binding pocket. The final LeuBAT mutant binds the SSRI sertraline with a binding constant of 18 nM and displays high-affinity binding to a range of SSRIs, SNRIs and a TCA. We determined 12 crystal structures of LeuBAT in complex with four classes of antidepressants. The chemically diverse inhibitors have a remarkably similar mode of binding in which they straddle transmembrane helix (TM) 3, wedge between TM3/TM8 and TM1/TM6, and lock the transporter in a sodium- and chloride-bound outward-facing open conformation. Together, these studies define common and simple principles for the action of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs on BATs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mapping of orthologous genes among species serves an important role in functional genomics by allowing researchers to develop hypotheses about gene function in one species based on what is known about the functions of orthologs in other species. Several tools for predicting orthologous gene relationships are available. However, these tools can give different results and identification of predicted orthologs is not always straightforward.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We report a simple but effective tool, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt), for rapid identification of orthologs. DIOPT integrates existing approaches, facilitating rapid identification of orthologs among human, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae. As compared to individual tools, DIOPT shows increased sensitivity with only a modest decrease in specificity. Moreover, the flexibility built into the DIOPT graphical user interface allows researchers with different goals to appropriately 'cast a wide net' or limit results to highest confidence predictions. DIOPT also displays protein and domain alignments, including percent amino acid identity, for predicted ortholog pairs. This helps users identify the most appropriate matches among multiple possible orthologs. To facilitate using model organisms for functional analysis of human disease-associated genes, we used DIOPT to predict high-confidence orthologs of disease genes in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and genes in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets. The results are accessible through the DIOPT diseases and traits query tool (DIOPT-DIST; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt-dist).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: DIOPT and DIOPT-DIST are useful resources for researchers working with model organisms, especially those who are interested in exploiting model organisms such as Drosophila to study the functions of human disease genes.},

@article{Jiang2016,
abstract = {A major bottleneck in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to proteins. While molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins, their relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an increasing role for computational function prediction. However, assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field remain challenging. We conducted the second critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to assess computational methods that automatically assign protein function. We evaluated 126 methods from 56 research groups for their ability to predict biological functions using Gene Ontology and gene-disease associations using Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3681 proteins from 18 species. CAFA2 featured expanded analysis compared with CAFA1, with regards to data set size, variety, and assessment metrics. To review progress in the field, the analysis compared the best methods from CAFA1 to those of CAFA2. The top-performing methods in CAFA2 outperformed those from CAFA1. This increased accuracy can be attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental annotations and improved methods for function prediction. The assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing algorithms is ontology specific, that different performance metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions, and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological process and human phenotype ontologies. While there was methodological improvement between CAFA1 and CAFA2, the interpretation of results and usefulness of individual methods remain context-dependent.},

abstract = {Increases in the environmental osmolarity are key determinants for the growth of microorganisms. To ensure a physiologically acceptable level of cellular hydration and turgor at high osmolarity, many bacteria accumulate compatible solutes. Osmotically controlled uptake systems allow the scavenging of these compounds from scarce environmental sources as effective osmoprotectants. A number of these systems belong to the BCCT family (betaine-choline-carnitine-transporter), sodium- or proton-coupled transporters (e.g. BetP and BetT respectively) that are ubiquitous in microorganisms. The BCCT family also contains CaiT, an L-carnitine/$\gamma$-butyrobetaine antiporter that is not involved in osmotic stress responses. The glycine betaine transporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a representative for osmoregulated symporters of the BCCT family and functions both as an osmosensor and osmoregulator. The crystal structure of BetP in an occluded conformation in complex with its substrate glycine betaine and two crystal structures of CaiT in an inward-facing open conformation in complex with L-carnitine and $\gamma$-butyrobetaine were reported recently. These structures and the wealth of biochemical data on the activity control of BetP in response to osmotic stress enable a correlation between the sensing of osmotic stress by a transporter protein with the ensuing regulation of transport activity. Molecular determinants governing the high-affinity binding of the compatible solutes by BetP and CaiT, the coupling in symporters and antiporters, and the osmoregulatory properties are discussed in detail for BetP and various BCCT carriers.},

Most, perhaps all, CGIs are sites of transcription initiation, including thousands that are remote from currently annotated promoters. Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

abstract = {Ontologies have proven very useful for capturing knowledge as a hierarchy of terms and their interrelationships. In biology a major challenge has been to construct ontologies of gene function given incomplete biological knowledge and inconsistencies in how this knowledge is manually curated. Here we show that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually curated Gene Ontology (GO). The network-extracted ontology (NeXO) contains 4,123 biological terms and 5,766 term-term relations, capturing 58{\%} of known cellular components. We also explore robust NeXO terms and term relations that were initially not cataloged in GO, a number of which have now been added based on our analysis. Using quantitative genetic interaction profiling and chemogenomics, we find further support for many of the uncharacterized terms identified by NeXO, including multisubunit structures related to protein trafficking or mitochondrial function. This work enables a shift from using ontologies to evaluate data to using data to construct and evaluate ontologies.},

abstract = {The importance of a residue for maintaining the structure and function of a protein can usually be inferred from how conserved it appears in a multiple sequence alignment of that protein and its homologues. A reliable metric for quantifying residue conservation is desirable. Over the last two decades many such scores have been proposed, but none has emerged as a generally accepted standard. This work surveys the range of scores that biologists, biochemists, and, more recently, bioinformatics workers have developed, and reviews the intrinsic problems associated with developing and evaluating such a score. A general formula is proposed that may be used to compare the properties of different particular conservation scores or as a measure of conservation in its own right. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination has evolved to maintain genetic integrity in all organisms. Although many reactions that occur during homologous recombination are known, it is unclear where, when and how they occur in cells. Here, by using conventional and super-resolution microscopy, we describe the progression of DSB repair in live Escherichia coli. Specifically, we investigate whether homologous recombination can occur efficiently between distant sister loci that have segregated to opposite halves of an E. coli cell. We show that a site-specific DSB in one sister can be repaired efficiently using distant sister homology. After RecBCD processing of the DSB, RecA is recruited to the cut locus, where it nucleates into a bundle that contains many more RecA molecules than can associate with the two single-stranded DNA regions that form at the DSB. Mature bundles extend along the long axis of the cell, in the space between the bulk nucleoid and the inner membrane. Bundle formation is followed by pairing, in which the two ends of the cut locus relocate at the periphery of the nucleoid and together move rapidly towards the homology of the uncut sister. After sister locus pairing, RecA bundles disassemble and proteins that act late in homologous recombination are recruited to give viable recombinants 1-2-generation-time equivalents after formation of the initial DSB. Mutated RecA proteins that do not form bundles are defective in sister pairing and in DSB-induced repair. This work reveals an unanticipated role of RecA bundles in channelling the movement of the DNA DSB ends, thereby facilitating the long-range homology search that occurs before the strand invasion and transfer reactions.},

AIF fulfills its lethal function after its release from mitochondria and its translocation to the nucleus of the dying cell. The contribution of AIF to programmed cell death is dependent upon the cell type and apoptotic insult. Recent in vivo data indicate that, in addition to its lethal activity, AIF plays a vital mitochondrial role in healthy cells. A segment of AIF which is dispensable for its apoptotic function carries an NADH-oxidase domain that regulates the respiratory chain complex I and is required for cell survival, proliferation and mitochondrial integrity. Mice that express reduced levels of AIF constitute a reliable model of complex I deficiency. Here we discuss recent reports on the survival-related function(s) of AIF.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP(2)) is an activator of mammalian inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Multiscale simulations, via a sequential combination of coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics, enabled exploration of the interactions of PIP(2) molecules within the inner leaflet of a lipid bilayer membrane with possible binding sites on Kir channels. Three Kir channel structures were investigated: X-ray structures of KirBac1.1 and of a Kir3.1-KirBac1.3 chimera and a homology model of Kir6.2. Coarse-grained simulations of the Kir channels in PIP(2)-containing lipid bilayers identified the PIP(2)-binding site on each channel. These models of the PIP(2)-channel complexes were refined by conversion to an atomistic representation followed by molecular dynamics simulation in a lipid bilayer. All three channels were revealed to contain a conserved binding site at the N-terminal end of the slide (M0) helix, at the interface between adjacent subunits of the channel. This binding site agrees with mutagenesis data and is in the proximity of the site occupied by a detergent molecule in the Kir chimera channel crystal. Polar contacts in the coarse-grained simulations corresponded to long-lived electrostatic and H-bonding interactions between the channel and PIP(2) in the atomistic simulations, enabling identification of key side chains.},

abstract = {The interaction of colicins with target cells is a paradigm for protein import. To enter cells, bactericidal colicins parasitize Escherichia coli outer membrane receptors whose physiological purpose is the import of essential metabolites. Colicins E1 and E3 initially bind to the BtuB receptor, whose beta-barrel pore is occluded by an N-terminal globular "plug". The x-ray structure of a complex of BtuB with the coiled-coil BtuB-binding domain of colicin E3 did not reveal displacement of the BtuB plug that would allow passage of the colicin (Kurisu, G., S. D. Zakharov, M. V. Zhalnina, S. Bano, V. Y. Eroukova, T. I. Rokitskaya, Y. N. Antonenko, M. C. Wiener, and W. A. Cramer. 2003. Nat. Struct. Biol. 10:948-954). This correlates with the inability of BtuB to form ion channels in planar bilayers, shown in this work, suggesting that an additional outer membrane protein(s) is required for colicin import across the outer membrane. The identity and interaction properties of this OMP were analyzed in planar bilayer experiments.OmpF and TolC channels in planar bilayers were occluded by colicins E3 and E1, respectively, from the trans-side of the membrane. Occlusion was dependent upon a cis-negative transmembrane potential. A positive potential reversibly opened OmpF and TolC channels. Colicin N, which uses only OmpF for entry, occludes OmpF in planar bilayers with the same orientation constraints as colicins E1 and E3. The OmpF recognition sites of colicins E3 and N, and the TolC recognition site of colicin E1, were found to reside in the N-terminal translocation domains. These data are considered in the context of a two-receptor translocon model for colicin entry into cells.},

@article{Ghosal2013,
abstract = {Preservation of genome integrity is an essential process for cell homeostasis. During the course of life of a single cell, the genome is constantly damaged by endogenous and exogenous agents. To ensure genome stability, cells use a global signaling network, namely the DNA damage response (DDR) to sense and repair DNA damage. DDR senses different types of DNA damage and coordinates a response that includes activation of transcription, cell cycle control, DNA repair pathways, apoptosis, senescence, and cell death. Despite several repair mechanisms that repair different types of DNA lesions, it is likely that the replication machinery would still encounter lesions that are mis-repaired or not repaired. Replication of damaged genome would result in high frequency of fork collapse and genome instability. In this scenario, the cells employ the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway that recruits a specialized low fidelity translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase to bypass the lesions for repair at a later time point. Thus, DDT is not a repair pathway per se, but provides a mechanism to tolerate DNA lesions during replication thereby increasing survival and preventing genome instability. Paradoxically, DDT process is also associated with increased mutagenesis, which can in turn drive the cell to cancer development. Thus, DDT process functions as a double-edged sword guarding the genome. In this review, we will discuss the replication stress induced DNA damage-signaling cascade, the stabilization and rescue of stalled replication forks by the DDT pathway and the effect of the DDT pathway on cancer.},

The principles of these recycling pathways are framed against current-day industrial reality, by discussing predominant industrial technologies, design strategies and recycling examples of specific waste streams. Starting with an overview on types of solid plastic waste (SPW) and their origins, the manuscript continues with a discussion on the different valorisation options for SPW. The section on mechanical recycling contains an overview of current sorting technologies, specific challenges for mechanical recycling such as thermo-mechanical or lifetime degradation and the immiscibility of polymer blends. It also includes some industrial examples such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling, and SPW from post-consumer packaging, end-of-life vehicles or electr(on)ic devices. A separate section is dedicated to the relationship between design and recycling, emphasizing the role of concepts such as Design from Recycling. The section on chemical recycling collects a state-of-the-art on techniques such as chemolysis, pyrolysis, fluid catalytic cracking, hydrogen techniques and gasification. Additionally, this review discusses the main challenges (and some potential remedies) to these recycling strategies and ground them in the relevant polymer science, thus providing an academic angle as well as an applied one.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide variants represent a prevalent form of genetic variation. Mutations in the coding regions are frequently associated with the development of various genetic diseases. Computational tools for the prediction of the effects of mutations on protein function are very important for analysis of single nucleotide variants and their prioritization for experimental characterization. Many computational tools are already widely employed for this purpose. Unfortunately, their comparison and further improvement is hindered by large overlaps between the training datasets and benchmark datasets, which lead to biased and overly optimistic reported performances. In this study, we have constructed three independent datasets by removing all duplicities, inconsistencies and mutations previously used in the training of evaluated tools. The benchmark dataset containing over 43,000 mutations was employed for the unbiased evaluation of eight established prediction tools: MAPP, nsSNPAnalyzer, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, SIFT and SNAP. The six best performing tools were combined into a consensus classifier PredictSNP, resulting into significantly improved prediction performance, and at the same time returned results for all mutations, confirming that consensus prediction represents an accurate and robust alternative to the predictions delivered by individual tools. A user-friendly web interface enables easy access to all eight prediction tools, the consensus classifier PredictSNP and annotations from the Protein Mutant Database and the UniProt database. The web server and the datasets are freely available to the academic community at http://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/predictsnp.},

Our results indicate that the nucleosome behaves as a fluctuating barrier that locally increases pause density, slows pause recovery, and reduces the apparent pause-free velocity of Pol II. The polymerase, rather than actively separating DNA from histones, functions instead as a ratchet that rectifies nucleosomal fluctuations. We also obtained direct evidence that transcription through a nucleosome involves transfer of the core histones behind the transcribing polymerase via a transient DNA loop. The interplay between polymerase dynamics and nucleosome fluctuations provides a physical basis for the regulation of eukaryotic transcription.},

This man illustrates an important quality of a class of problems, namely, the NP-complete problems: if you can prove that a problem is in this class, then it has no known polynomial-time solution that is guaranteed to work in general. This quality implies that the problem is difficult to deal with in practice. The focus of this book is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand the essence of NP-complete problems; Computers and Intractability does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems. (There is even a chapter on advanced topics, with numerous references.) Computers and Intractability also contains a list of more than 300 problems-most of which are known to be NP-complete-with comments and references.},

abstract = {Activation of mechanosensitive ion channels by physical force underlies many physiological processes including the sensation of touch, hearing and pain. TRAAK (also known as KCNK4) ion channels are neuronally expressed members of the two-pore domain K(+) (K2P) channel family and are mechanosensitive. They are involved in controlling mechanical and temperature nociception in mice. Mechanosensitivity of TRAAK is mediated directly through the lipid bilayer--it is a membrane-tension-gated channel. However, the molecular mechanism of TRAAK channel gating and mechanosensitivity is unknown. Here we present crystal structures of TRAAK in conductive and non-conductive conformations defined by the presence of permeant ions along the conduction pathway. In the non-conductive state, a lipid acyl chain accesses the channel cavity through a 5 {\AA}-wide lateral opening in the membrane inner leaflet and physically blocks ion passage. In the conductive state, rotation of a transmembrane helix (TM4) about a central hinge seals the intramembrane opening, preventing lipid block of the cavity and permitting ion entry. Additional rotation of a membrane interacting TM2-TM3 segment, unique to mechanosensitive K2Ps, against TM4 may further stabilize the conductive conformation. Comparison of the structures reveals a biophysical explanation for TRAAK mechanosensitivity--an expansion in cross-sectional area up to 2.7 nm(2) in the conductive state is expected to create a membrane-tension-dependent energy difference between conformations that promotes force activation. Our results show how tension of the lipid bilayer can be harnessed to control gating and mechanosensitivity of a eukaryotic ion channel.},

abstract = {Two-component signal-transducing systems are ubiquitously distributed communication interfaces in bacteria. They consist of a histidine kinase that senses a specific environmental stimulus and a cognate response regulator that mediates the cellular response, mostly through differential expression of target genes. Histidine kinases are typically transmembrane proteins harboring at least two domains: an input (or sensor) domain and a cytoplasmic transmitter (or kinase) domain. They can be identified and classified by virtue of their conserved cytoplasmic kinase domains. In contrast, the sensor domains are highly variable, reflecting the plethora of different signals and modes of sensing. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms of stimulus perception by bacterial histidine kinases, we here survey sensor domain architecture and topology within the bacterial membrane, functional aspects related to this topology, and sequence and phylogenetic conservation. Based on these criteria, three groups of histidine kinases can be differentiated. (i) Periplasmic-sensing histidine kinases detect their stimuli (often small solutes) through an extracellular input domain. (ii) Histidine kinases with sensing mechanisms linked to the transmembrane regions detect stimuli (usually membrane-associated stimuli, such as ionic strength, osmolarity, turgor, or functional state of the cell envelope) via their membrane-spanning segments and sometimes via additional short extracellular loops. (iii) Cytoplasmic-sensing histidine kinases (either membrane anchored or soluble) detect cellular or diffusible signals reporting the metabolic or developmental state of the cell. This review provides an overview of mechanisms of stimulus perception for members of all three groups of bacterial signal-transducing histidine kinases.},

Fringe proteins can positively and negatively modulate the ability of Notch ligands to activate the Notch receptor. Here we establish the biochemical mechanism of Fringe action. Drosophila and mammalian Fringe proteins possess a fucose-specific beta1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that initiates elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats of Notch. We obtained biological evidence that Fringe-dependent elongation of O-linked fucose on Notch modulates Notch signalling by using co-culture assays in mammalian cells and by expression of an enzymatically inactive Fringe mutant in Drosophila. The post-translational modification of Notch by Fringe represents a striking example of modulation of a signalling event by differential receptor glycosylation and identifies a mechanism that is likely to be relevant to other signalling pathways.},

@article{Austad2018,
abstract = {Lay Summary: An evolutionary mechanism of aging was hypothesized 60 years ago to be the genetic trade-off between early life fitness and late life mortality. Genetic evidence supporting this hypothesis was unavailable then, but has accumulated recently. These tradeoffs, known as antagonistic pleiotropy, are common, perhaps ubiquitous. George Williams' 1957 paper developed the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of aging, which had previously been hinted at by Peter Medawar. Antagonistic pleiotropy, as it applies to aging, hypothesizes that animals possess genes that enhance fitness early in life but diminish it in later life and that such genes can be favored by natural selection because selection is stronger early in life even as they cause the aging phenotype to emerge. No genes of the sort hypothesized by Williams were known 60 years ago, but modern molecular biology has now discovered hundreds of genes that, when their activity is enhanced, suppressed, or turned off, lengthen life and enhance health under laboratory conditions. Does this provide strong support for Williams' hypothesis? What are the implications of Williams' hypothesis for the modern goal of medically intervening to enhance and prolong human health? Here we briefly review the current state of knowledge on antagonistic pleiotropy both under wild and laboratory conditions. Overall, whenever antagonistic pleiotropy effects have been seriously investigated, they have been found. However, not all trade-offs are directly between reproduction and longevity as is often assumed. The discovery that antagonistic pleiotropy is common if not ubiquitous implies that a number of molecular mechanisms of aging may be widely shared among organisms and that these mechanisms of aging can be potentially alleviated by targeted interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

@article{Boyle2017,
abstract = {A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic variation and disease. Intui-tively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome—including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in dis-ease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an ''omnigenic'' model. The longest-standing question in genetics is to understand how genetic variation contributes to phenotypic variation. In the early 1900s, there was fierce debate between the Mendelians—who were inspired by Mendel's work on pea genetics and focused on discrete, monogenic phenotypes—and the biometricians, who were interested in the inheritance of continuous traits such as height. The biometricians believed that Mendelian ge-netics could not explain the continuous distribution of variation observed for many traits in humans and other species. This debate was resolved in a seminal 1918 paper by R.A. Fisher, who showed that, if many genes affect a trait, then the random sampling of alleles at each gene produces a continuous, normally distributed phenotype in the population (Fisher, 1918). As the number of genes grows very large, the contribution of each gene becomes correspondingly smaller, leading in the limit to Fisher's famous ''infinitesimal model'' (Barton et al., 2016). Despite the success of the infinitesimal model in describing inheritance patterns, especially in plant and animal breeding, it was unclear throughout the 20th century how many genes would actually be important for driving complex traits. Indeed, human geneticists expected that even complex traits would be driven by a handful of moderate-effect loci—thus giving rise to large numbers of mapping studies that were, in retrospect, greatly underpowered. For example, an elegant 1999 analysis of allele sharing in autistic siblings concluded from the lack of significant hits that there must be ''a large number of loci (perhaps R15).'' This prediction was strikingly high at the time but seems quaintly low now (Risch et al., 1999; Weiner et al., 2016). Since around 2006, the advent of genome-wide association studies, and more recently exome sequencing, has provided the first detailed understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pore-forming colicins are water-soluble bacteriocins capable of binding to and translocating through the Escherichia coli cell envelope. They then undergo a transition to a transmembrane ion channel in the cytoplasmic membrane leading to bacterial death. Colicin N is the smallest pore-forming colicin known to date (40 kDa instead of the more usual 60 kDa) and the crystal structure of its membrane receptor, the porin OmpF, is already known. Structural knowledge of colicin N is therefore important for a molecular understanding of colicin toxicity and is relevant to toxic mechanisms in general.

RESULTS: The crystal structure of colicin N reveals a novel receptor-binding domain containing a six-stranded antiparallel beta sheet wrapped around the 63 A long N-terminal alpha helix of the pore-forming domain. The pore-forming domain adopts a ten alpha-helix bundle that has been observed previously in the pore-forming domains of colicin A, la and E1. The translocation domain, however, does not appear to adopt any regular structure. Models for receptor binding and translocation through the outer membrane are proposed based on the structure and biochemical data.

CONCLUSIONS: The colicin N-ompF system is now the structurally best-defined translocation pathway. Knowledge of the colicin N structure, coupled with the structure of its receptor, OmpF, and previously published biochemical data, limits the numerous possibilities of translocation and leads to a model in which the translocation domain inserts itself through the porin pore, the receptor-binding domain stays outside and the pore-forming domain translocates along the outer wall of the trimeric porin channel.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mass spectrometry (MS)-based high-throughput quantitative proteomics shows great potential in large-scale clinical biomarker studies, identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in biological samples. However, there are unique challenges in analyzing the quantitative proteomics data. One issue is that the quantification of a given peptide is often missing in a subset of the experiments, especially for less abundant peptides. Another issue is that different MS experiments of the same study have significantly varying numbers of peptides quantified, which can result in more missing peptide abundances in an experiment that has a smaller total number of quantified peptides. To detect as many biomarker proteins as possible, it is necessary to develop bioinformatics methods that appropriately handle these challenges.

RESULTS: We propose a Significance Analysis for Large-scale Proteomics Studies (SALPS) that handles missing peptide intensity values caused by the two mechanisms mentioned above. Our model has a robust performance in both simulated data and proteomics data from a large clinical study. Because varying patients' sample qualities and deviating instrument performances are not avoidable for clinical studies performed over the course of several years, we believe that our approach will be useful to analyze large-scale clinical proteomics data.

abstract = {Cytokinesis in unicellular organisms sometimes entails a division of labor between cells leading to lineage-specific aging. To investigate the potential benefits of asymmetrical cytokinesis, we created a mathematical model to simulate the robustness and fitness of dividing systems displaying different degrees of damage segregation and size asymmetries. The model suggests that systems dividing asymmetrically (size-wise) or displaying damage segregation can withstand higher degrees of damage before entering clonal senescence. When considering population fitness, a system producing different-sized progeny like budding yeast is predicted to benefit from damage retention only at high damage propagation rates. In contrast, the fitness of a system of equal-sized progeny is enhanced by damage segregation regardless of damage propagation rates, suggesting that damage partitioning may also provide an evolutionary advantage in systems dividing by binary fission. Indeed, by using Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model, we experimentally demonstrate that damaged proteins are unevenly partitioned during cytokinesis and the damage-enriched sibling suffers from a prolonged generation time and accelerated aging. This damage retention in S. pombe is, like in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sir2p- and cytoskeleton-dependent, suggesting this to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. We suggest that sibling-specific aging may be a result of the strong selective advantage of damage segregation, which may be more common in nature than previously anticipated.},

We report here that a comparison of experimentally supported functional annotations among homologs from 13 genomes mostly supports this model. We show that to analyze GO annotation effectively, several confounding factors need to be controlled: authorship bias, variation of GO term frequency among species, variation of background similarity among species pairs, and propagated annotation bias. After controlling for these biases, we observe that orthologs have generally more similar functional annotations than paralogs. This is especially strong for sub-cellular localization. We observe only a weak decrease in functional similarity with increasing sequence divergence. These findings hold over a large diversity of species; notably orthologs from model organisms such as E. coli, yeast or mouse have conserved function with human proteins. {\textcopyright} 2012 Altenhoff et al.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A central question in reverse engineering of genetic networks consists in determining the dependencies and regulating relationships among genes. This paper addresses the problem of inferring genetic regulatory networks from time-series gene-expression profiles. By adopting a probabilistic modeling framework compatible with the family of models represented by dynamic Bayesian networks and probabilistic Boolean networks, this paper proposes a network inference algorithm to recover not only the direct gene connectivity but also the regulating orientations. RESULTS: Based on the minimum description length principle, a novel network inference algorithm is proposed that greatly shrinks the search space for graphical solutions and achieves a good trade-off between modeling complexity and data fitting. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves good performance in the case of synthetic networks. Compared with existing state-of-the-art results in the literature, the proposed algorithm exceptionally excels in efficiency, accuracy, robustness and scalability. Given a time-series dataset for Drosophila melanogaster, the paper proposes a genetic regulatory network involved in Drosophila's muscle development.

abstract = {The extreme durability of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) debris has rendered it a long-term environmental burden. At the same time, current recycling efforts still lack sustainability. Two recently discovered bacterial enzymes that specifically degrade PET represent a promising solution. First, Ideonella sakaiensis PETase, a structurally well-characterized consensus $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold enzyme, converts PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). MHETase, the second key enzyme, hydrolyzes MHET to the PET educts terephthalate and ethylene glycol. Here, we report the crystal structures of active ligand-free MHETase and MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable MHET analog. MHETase, which is reminiscent of feruloyl esterases, possesses a classic $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase domain and a lid domain conferring substrate specificity. In the light of structure-based mapping of the active site, activity assays, mutagenesis studies and a first structure-guided alteration of substrate specificity towards bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) reported here, we anticipate MHETase to be a valuable resource to further advance enzymatic plastic degradation.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent potassium channels are essential for the generation of nerve impulses. Voltage sensitivity is conferred by charged residues located mainly in the fourth transmembrane segment (S4) of each of the four identical subunits that make up the channel. These charged segments relocate when the potential difference across the membrane changes, controlling the ability of the pore to conduct ions. In the crystal structure of the Aeropyrum pernix potassium channel KvAP, the S4 and part of the third (S3B) transmembrane alpha-helices are connected by a hairpin turn in an arrangement termed the 'voltage-sensor paddle'. This structure was proposed to move through the lipid bilayer during channel activation, transporting positive charges across a large fraction of the membrane. Here we show that replacing the first S4 arginine by histidine in the Shaker potassium channel creates a proton pore when the cell is hyperpolarized. Formation of this pore does not support the paddle model, as protons would not have access to a lipid-buried histidine. We conclude that, at hyperpolarized potentials, water and protons from the internal and external solutions must be separated by a narrow barrier in the channel protein that focuses the electric field to a small voltage-sensitive region.},

Dysfunction of one DNA repair pathway may be compensated for by the function of another compensatory DDR pathway, which may be increased and contribute to resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, DDR pathways make an ideal target for therapeutic intervention; first, to prevent or reverse therapy resistance; and second, using a synthetic lethal approach to specifically kill cancer cells that are dependent on a compensatory DNA repair pathway for survival in the context of cancer-associated oxidative and replicative stress.

Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8 {\AA}. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended $\alpha$-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the $\alpha$-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) is a major cholesterol carrier that supports lipid transport and injury repair in the brain. APOE polymorphic alleles are the main genetic determinants of Alzheimer disease (AD) risk: individuals carrying the $\epsilon$4 allele are at increased risk of AD compared with those carrying the more common $\epsilon$3 allele, whereas the $\epsilon$2 allele decreases risk. Presence of the APOE $\epsilon$4 allele is also associated with increased risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and age-related cognitive decline during normal ageing. Apo-E-lipoproteins bind to several cell-surface receptors to deliver lipids, and also to hydrophobic amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide, which is thought to initiate toxic events that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. Apo-E isoforms differentially regulate A$\beta$ aggregation and clearance in the brain, and have distinct functions in regulating brain lipid transport, glucose metabolism, neuronal signalling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function. In this Review, we describe current knowledge on Apo-E in the CNS, with a particular emphasis on the clinical and pathological features associated with carriers of different Apo-E isoforms. We also discuss A$\beta$-dependent and A$\beta$-independent mechanisms that link Apo-E4 status with AD risk, and consider how to design effective strategies for AD therapy by targeting Apo-E. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {PURPOSE An antibody-drug conjugate consisting of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to the anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (mAb) cAC10, with eight drug moieties per mAb, was previously shown to have potent cytotoxic activity against CD30(+) malignant cells. To determine the effect of drug loading on antibody-drug conjugate therapeutic potential, we assessed cAC10 antibody-drug conjugates containing different drug-mAb ratios in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Coupling MMAE to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of cAC10 created an antibody-drug conjugate population, which was purified using hydrophobic interaction chromatography to yield antibody-drug conjugates with two, four, and eight drugs per antibody (E2, E4, and E8, respectively). Antibody-drug conjugate potency was tested in vitro against CD30(+) lines followed by in vivo xenograft models. The maximum-tolerated dose and pharmacokinetic profiles of the antibody-drug conjugates were investigated in mice. RESULTS Although antibody-drug conjugate potency in vitro was directly dependent on drug loading (IC(50) values E8{\textless}E4{\textless}E2), the in vivo antitumor activity of E4 was comparable with E8 at equal mAb doses, although the E4 contained half the amount of MMAE per mAb. E2 was also an active antitumor agent but required higher doses. The maximum-tolerated dose of E2 in mice was at least double that of E4, which in turn was twice that of E8. MMAE loading affected plasma clearance, as E8 cleared 3-fold faster than E4 and 5-fold faster than E2. CONCLUSIONS By decreasing drug loading per antibody, the therapeutic index was increased demonstrating that drug loading is a key design parameter for antibody-drug conjugates.},

However, despite such tenuous provenance, the gay gene has persisted as a reference in science news, popular science writings, and in press releases and editorials about biomedical research. An examination of the life of the gay gene in U.K. news media demonstrates that the gay gene has become an assumed back-story to genetic sexuality research over time, and that the critique of its very existence has been diminished. Latterly, the gay gene has entered into the online biomedical databases of the 21st century with the same pattern of persistence and diminishing critique. This article draws on an analysis of the U.K. press and online databases to represent the process through which the address of the gay gene has shifted and become an index of biomedicalization. The consequent unmooring of the gay gene from accountability and accuracy demonstrates that the organization of biomedical databases could benefit from greater cross-disciplinary attention.},

They are produced by strains of E. coli carrying a colicinogenic plasmid that bears the genetic determinants for colicin synthesis, immunity, and release. Insights gained into each fundamental aspect of their biology are presented: their synthesis, which is under SOS regulation; their release into the extracellular medium, which involves the colicin lysis protein; and their uptake mechanisms and modes of action. Colicins are organized into three domains, each one involved in a different step of the process of killing sensitive bacteria. The structures of some colicins are known at the atomic level and are discussed. Colicins exert their lethal action by first binding to specific receptors, which are outer membrane proteins used for the entry of specific nutrients. They are then translocated through the outer membrane and transit through the periplasm by either the Tol or the TonB system. The components of each system are known, and their implication in the functioning of the system is described. Colicins then reach their lethal target and act either by forming a voltage-dependent channel into the inner membrane or by using their endonuclease activity on DNA, rRNA, or tRNA. The mechanisms of inhibition by specific and cognate immunity proteins are presented. Finally, the use of colicins as laboratory or biotechnological tools and their mode of evolution are discussed.},

Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

abstract = {Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse a thermodynamically uphill uptake of the neurotransmitter glutamate from the synaptic cleft into the cytoplasm of glia and neuronal cells by harnessing the energy of pre-existing electrochemical gradients of ions. Crucial to the reaction is the conformational transition of the transporters between outward and inward facing states, in which the substrate binding sites are accessible from the extracellular space and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here we describe the crystal structure of a double cysteine mutant of a glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii, Glt(Ph), which is trapped in the inward facing state by cysteine crosslinking. Together with the previously determined crystal structures of Glt(Ph) in the outward facing state, the structure of the crosslinked mutant allows us to propose a molecular mechanism by which Glt(Ph) and, by analogy, mammalian glutamate transporters mediate sodium-coupled substrate uptake.},

It is found that for some values of k, and for m not too large, intervals obtained in this way are shorter than those using the F distribution or the Studentized range.

Both are interfaced with an attention mechanism that recombines a fixed encoding of the source tokens based on the decoder state. We propose an alternative approach which instead relies on a single 2D convolutional neural network across both sequences. Each layer of our network re-codes source tokens on the basis of the output sequence produced so far. Attention-like properties are therefore pervasive throughout the network. Our model yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems, while being conceptually simpler and having fewer parameters.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Oncogenes are known drivers of cancer phenotypes and targets of molecular therapies; however, the complex and diverse signaling mechanisms regulated by oncogenes and potential routes to targeted therapy resistance remain to be fully understood. To this end, we present an approach to infer regulatory mechanisms downstream of the HER2 driver oncogene in SUM-225 metastatic breast cancer cells from dynamic gene expression patterns using a succession of analytical techniques, including a novel MP grammars method to mathematically model putative regulatory interactions among sets of clustered genes. RESULTS: Our method highlighted regulatory interactions previously identified in the cell line and a novel finding that the HER2 oncogene, as opposed to the proto-oncogene, upregulates expression of the E2F2 transcription factor. By targeted gene knockdown we show the significance of this, demonstrating that cancer cell-matrix adhesion and outgrowth were markedly inhibited when E2F2 levels were reduced. Thus, validating in this context that upregulation of E2F2 represents a key intermediate event in a HER2 oncogene-directed gene expression-based signaling circuit. This work demonstrates how predictive modeling of longitudinal gene expression data combined with multiple systems-level analyses can be used to accurately predict downstream signaling pathways. Here, our integrated method was applied to reveal insights as to how the HER2 oncogene drives a specific cancer cell phenotype, but it is adaptable to investigate other oncogenes and model systems.

Subsequent structure comparisons between all members of this set detect homologous folds with low sequence identity but highly conserved structures. By softening the requirement on structural similarity, families of analogous proteins are obtained that have related folds but more diverse structures. Representatives are selected to give a non-analogous data set. Starting with 1410 chains from the Brookhaven Data Bank, we generate a set of 150 non-homologous folds and a set of 112 non-analogous folds.

By analyzing a newly isolated mutant (dig-1) that displaces the gonad, we discovered that cell interactions coordinate the spatial relationships among the different components of the egg-laying system. First, the gonad induces the formation of the vulva, and vulval induction by dorsal gonads strongly suggests that the inductive signal can act at a distance. Second, the gonad acts at a distance to regulate the migrations of the sex myoblasts that generate the egg-laying musculature. Third, the positions of the axonal branch and synapses of each HSN neuron are displaced correspondingly with the rest of the egg-laying system in dig-1 animals, which suggests that cell interactions also control aspects of HSN development.},

abstract = {Background: Microbes drive the biogeochemistry that fuels the planet. Microbial viruses modulate their hosts directly through mortality and horizontal gene transfer, and indirectly by re-programming host metabolisms during infection. However, our ability to study these virus-host interactions is limited by methods that are low-throughput and heavily reliant upon the subset of organisms that are in culture. One way forward are culture-independent metagenomic approaches, but these novel methods are rarely rigorously tested, especially for studies of environmental viruses, air microbiomes, extreme environment microbiology and other areas with constrained sample amounts. Here we perform replicated experiments to evaluate Roche 454, Illumina HiSeq, and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing and library preparation protocols on virus metagenomes generated from as little as 10pg of DNA.Results: Using {\%}G + C content to compare metagenomes, we find that (i) metagenomes are highly replicable, (ii) some treatment effects are minimal, e.g., sequencing technology choice has 6-fold less impact than varying input DNA amount, and (iii) when restricted to a limited DNA concentration ({\textless}1$\mu$g), changing the amount of amplification produces little variation. These trends were also observed when examining the metagenomes for gene function and assembly performance, although the latter more closely aligned to sequencing effort and read length than preparation steps tested. Among Illumina library preparation options, transposon-based libraries diverged from all others and adaptor ligation was a critical step for optimizing sequencing yields.Conclusions: These data guide researchers in generating systematic, comparative datasets to understand complex ecosystems, and suggest that neither varied amplification nor sequencing platforms will deter such efforts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Solonenko et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Alternatively spliced exons that are either short in length or contain weak splice sites show the highest conservation level of those ESRs, especially toward the edges of exons. ESRs that are abundant in those subgroups show a different distribution between constitutively and alternatively spliced exons. Representatives of these ESRs and two SR protein binding sites were shown, experimentally, to display variable regulatory effects on alternative splicing, depending on their relative locations in the exon.

Its activity must be precisely controlled, but the mechanism by which Lon is regulated in response to different environments is not known. Facultative anaerobes in the Enterobacteriaceae family, mostly symbionts and pathogens, encounter both anaerobic and aerobic environments inside and outside the host's body, respectively. The bacteria characteristically have two cysteine residues on the Lon protease (P) domain surface that unusually form a disulfide bond. Here we show that the cysteine residues act as a redox switch of Lon. Upon disulfide bond reduction, the exit pore of the P-domain ring narrows by ∼30{\%}, thus interrupting product passage and decreasing activity by 80{\%}; disulfide bonding by oxidation restores the pore size and activity. The redox switch (E°' = -227 mV) is appropriately tuned to respond to variation between anaerobic and aerobic conditions, thus optimizing the cellular proteolysis level for each environment.},

abstract = {Binding of enzymatic E colicins to the vitamin B12 receptor, BtuB, is the first stage in a cascade of events that culminate in the translocation of the cytotoxic nuclease into the Escherichia coli cytoplasm and release of its tightly bound immunity protein. A dogma of colicin biology is that the toxin coiled-coil connecting its functional domains must unfold or unfurl to span the periplasm, with recent reports claiming this reaction is initiated by receptor binding. We report isothermal titration calorimetry data of BtuB binding the endonuclease toxin ColE9 and a disulfide form (ColE9S-S) where unfolding of the coiled-coil is prevented and, as a consequence, the toxin is biologically inactive. Contrary to expectation, the thermodynamics of receptor binding, characterized by large negative values for TDeltaS, are identical for the two colicins, arguing against any form of BtuB-induced unfolding. We go on to delineate key features of the "colicin translocon" that assembles at the cell surface after BtuB binding by using a complex of histidine-tagged Im9 bound to ColE9S-S. First, we show that the porin OmpF is recruited directly to the BtuB.colicin complex to form the translocon. Second, recruitment is through the natively unfolded region of the colicin translocation domain, with this domain likely having two contact points for OmpF. Finally, the immunity protein is not released during its assembly. Our study demonstrates that although colicin unfolding is undoubtedly a prerequisite for E. coli cell death, it must occur after assembly of the translocon.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are trimeric ATP-activated ion channels permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+. The seven P2X receptor subtypes are implicated in physiological processes that include modulation of synaptic transmission, contraction of smooth muscle, secretion of chemical transmitters and regulation of immune responses. Despite the importance of P2X receptors in cellular physiology, the three-dimensional composition of the ATP-binding site, the structural mechanism of ATP-dependent ion channel gating and the architecture of the open ion channel pore are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in complex with ATP and a new structure of the apo receptor. The agonist-bound structure reveals a previously unseen ATP-binding motif and an open ion channel pore. ATP binding induces cleft closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket, flexing of the lower body $\beta$-sheet and a radial expansion of the extracellular vestibule. The structural widening of the extracellular vestibule is directly coupled to the opening of the ion channel pore by way of an iris-like expansion of the transmembrane helices. The structural delineation of the ATP-binding site and the ion channel pore, together with the conformational changes associated with ion channel gating, will stimulate development of new pharmacological agents.},

abstract = {Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) results in neuropathological and biochemical consequences in the human visual system. Using a recently developed mouse model of r-mTBI, with control mice receiving repetitive anesthesia alone (r-sham) we assessed the effects on the retina and optic nerve using histology, immunohistochemistry, proteomic and lipidomic analyses at 3 weeks post injury. Retina tissue was used to determine retinal ganglion cell (RGC) number, while optic nerve tissue was examined for cellularity, myelin content, protein and lipid changes. Increased cellularity and areas of demyelination were clearly detectable in optic nerves in r-mTBI, but not in r-sham. These changes were accompanied by a 25{\%} decrease in the total number of Brn3a-positive RGCs. Proteomic analysis of the optic nerves demonstrated various changes consistent with a negative effect of r-mTBI on major cellular processes like depolymerization of microtubules, disassembly of filaments and loss of neurons, manifested by decrease of several proteins, including neurofilaments (NEFH, NEFM, NEFL), tubulin (TUBB2A, TUBA4A), microtubule-associated proteins (MAP1A, MAP1B), collagen (COL6A1, COL6A3) and increased expression of other proteins, including heat shock proteins (HSP90B1, HSPB1), APOE and cathepsin D. Lipidomic analysis showed quantitative changes in a number of phospholipid species, including a significant increase in the total amount of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), including the molecular species 16:0, a known demyelinating agent. The overall amount of some ether phospholipids, like ether LPC, ether phosphatidylcholine and ether lysophosphatidylethanolamine were also increased, while the majority of individual molecular species of ester phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, were decreased. Results from the biochemical analysis correlate well with changes detected by histological and immunohistochemical methods and indicate the involvement of several important molecular pathways. This will allow future identification of therapeutic targets for improving the visual consequences of r-mTBI.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is widely believed to be driven by the production and deposition of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). For many years, investigators have been puzzled by the weak to nonexistent correlation between the amount of neuritic plaque pathology in the human brain and the degree of clinical dementia. Recent advances in our understanding of the development of amyloid pathology have helped solve this mystery. Substantial evidence now indicates that the solubility of Abeta, and the quantity of Abeta in different pools, may be more closely related to disease state. The composition of these pools of Abeta reflects different populations of amyloid deposits and has definite correlates with the clinical status of the patient. Imaging technologies, including new amyloid imaging agents based on the chemical structure of histologic dyes, are now making it possible to track amyloid pathology along with disease progression in the living patient. Interestingly, these approaches indicate that the Abeta deposited in AD is different from that found in animal models. In general, deposited Abeta is more easily cleared from the brain in animal models and does not show the same physical and biochemical characteristics as the amyloid found in AD. This raises important issues regarding the development and testing of future therapeutic agents.},

We found that nucleosomes with H3K4me3 and H3K9,14Ac modifications, together with RNA polymerase II, occupy the promoters of most protein-coding genes in human embryonic stem cells. Only a subset of these genes produce detectable full-length transcripts and are occupied by nucleosomes with H3K36me3 modifications, a hallmark of elongation. The other genes experience transcription initiation but show no evidence of elongation, suggesting that they are predominantly regulated at postinitiation steps. Genes encoding most developmental regulators fall into this group. Our results also identify a class of genes that are excluded from experiencing transcription initiation, at which mechanisms that prevent initiation must predominate. These observations extend to differentiated cells, suggesting that transcription initiation at most genes is a general phenomenon in human cells.},

abstract = {Colicins are proteins produced by some strains of Escherichia coli to kill competitors belonging to the same species. Among them, ColM (colicin M) is the only one that blocks the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, a specific bacterial cell-wall polymer essential for cell integrity. ColM acts in the periplasm by hydrolysing the phosphoester bond of the peptidoglycan lipid intermediate (lipid II). ColM cytotoxicity is dependent on FkpA of the targeted cell, a chaperone with peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Dissection of ColM was used to delineate the catalytic domain and to identify the active-site residues. The in vitro activity of the isolated catalytic domain towards lipid II was 50-fold higher than that of the full-length bacteriocin. Moreover, this domain was bactericidal in the absence of FkpA under conditions that bypass the import mechanism (FhuA-TonB machinery). Thus ColM undergoes a maturation process driven by FkpA that is not required for the activity of the isolated catalytic domain. Genes encoding proteins with similarity to the catalytic domain of ColM were identified in pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas and other genera. ColM acts on several structures of lipid II representative of the diversity of peptidoglycan chemotypes. All together, these data open the way to the potential use of ColM-related bacteriocins as broad spectrum antibacterial agents.},

abstract = {Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene products play an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in diverse species ranging from insects to humans. Human XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are direct inhibitors of at least two members of the caspase family of cell death proteases: caspase-3 and caspase-7. Here we compared the mechanism by which IAPs interfere with activation of caspase-3 and other effector caspases in cytosolic extracts where caspase activation was initiated by caspase-8, a proximal protease activated by ligation of TNF-family receptors, or by cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 can prevent the proteolytic processing of pro-caspases -3, -6 and -7 by blocking the cytochrome c-induced activation of pro-caspase-9. In contrast, these IAP family proteins did not prevent caspase-8-induced proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3; however, they subsequently inhibited active caspase-3 directly, thus blocking downstream apoptotic events such as further activation of caspases. These findings demonstrate that IAPs can suppress different apoptotic pathways by inhibiting distinct caspases and identify pro-caspase-9 as a new target for IAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis.},

abstract = {The widespread application of whole-genome sequencing is identifying numerous non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs), many of which are associated with disease. We analyzed nsSNPs from Humsavar and the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate why some proteins and domains are more tolerant of mutations than others. We identified 311 proteins and 112 Pfam families, corresponding to 2910 domains, as diseasesusceptible and 32 proteins and 67 Pfam families (10,783 domains) as diseaseresistant based on the relative numbers of disease-associated and neutral polymorphisms. Proteins with no significant difference from expected numbers of disease and polymorphism nsSNPs are classified as other. This classification takes into account the phenotypes of all known mutations in the protein or domain rather than simply classifying based on the presence or absence of disease nsSNPs. Of the two hypotheses suggested, our results support the model that disease-resistant domains and proteins are more able to tolerate mutations rather than having more lethal mutations that are not observed. Disease-resistant proteins and domains show significantly higher mutation rates and lower sequence conservation than disease-susceptible proteins and domains. Disease-susceptible proteins are more likely to be encoded by essential genes, are more central in protein-protein interaction networks and are less likely to contain loss-of-function mutations in healthy individuals. We use this classification for nsSNP phenotype prediction, predicting nsSNPs in disease-susceptible domains to be disease and those in disease-resistant domains to be polymorphism. In this way, we achieve higher accuracy than SIFT, a state-of-the-art algorithm.},

We furthermore highlight data showing the role of incomplete oligomeric rings (arcs) in pore formation and how this can explain small pores generated by oligomers of proteins belonging to the family.

abstract = {The extensive glycosylation and conformational mobility of gp120, the envelope glycoprotein of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), pose formidable barriers for crystallization. To surmount these difficulties, we used probability analysis to determine the most effective crystallization approach and derive equations which show that a strategy, which we term variational crystallization, substantially enhances the overall probability of crystallization for gp120. Variational crystallization focuses on protein modification as opposed to crystallization screening. Multiple variants of gp120 were analyzed with an iterative cycle involving a limited set of crystallization conditions and biochemical feedback on protease sensitivity, glycosylation status, and monoclonal antibody binding. Sources of likely conformational heterogeneity such as N-linked carbohydrates, flexible or mobile N and C termini, and variable internal loops were reduced or eliminated, and ligands such as CD4 and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of monoclonal antibodies were used to restrict conformational mobility as well as to alter the crystallization surface. Through successive cycles of manipulation involving 18 different variants, we succeeded in growing six different types of gp120 crystals. One of these, a ternary complex composed of gp120, its receptor CD4, and the Fab of the human neutralizing monoclonal antibody 17b, diffracts to a minimum Bragg spacing of at least 2.2 A and is suitable for structural analysis.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli are surrounded by two membranes with a thin peptidoglycan (PG)-layer located in between them in the periplasmic space. The outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is a 325-residue protein and it is the major protein component of the outer membrane of E. coli. Previous structure determinations have focused on the N-terminal fragment (residues 1-171) of OmpA, which forms an eight stranded transmembrane $\beta$-barrel in the outer membrane. Consequently it was suggested that OmpA is composed of two independently folded domains in which the N-terminal $\beta$-barrel traverses the outer membrane and the C-terminal domain (residues 180-325) adopts a folded structure in the periplasmic space. However, some reports have proposed that full-length OmpA can instead refold in a temperature dependent manner into a single domain forming a larger transmembrane pore. Here, we have determined the NMR solution structure of the C-terminal periplasmic domain of E. coli OmpA (OmpA(180-325)). Our structure reveals that the C-terminal domain folds independently into a stable globular structure that is homologous to the previously reported PG-associated domain of Neisseria meningitides RmpM. Our results lend credence to the two domain structure model and a PG-binding function for OmpA, and we could indeed localize the PG-binding site on the protein through NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments. On the other hand, we found no evidence for binding of OmpA(180-325) with the TonB protein. In addition, we have also expressed and purified full-length OmpA (OmpA(1-325)) to study the structure of the full-length protein in micelles and nanodiscs by NMR spectroscopy. In both membrane mimetic environments, the recombinant OmpA maintains its two domain structure that is connected through a flexible linker. A series of temperature-dependent HSQC experiments and relaxation dispersion NMR experiments detected structural destabilization in the bulge region of the periplasmic domain of OmpA above physiological temperatures, which may induce dimerization and play a role in triggering the previously reported larger pore formation.},

abstract = {Two-component systems (TCSs) are important for the adaptation and survival of bacteria and fungi under stress conditions. A TCS is often composed of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a response regulator (RR), which are relayed through sequential phosphorylation steps. However, the mechanism for how an SK is switched on in response to environmental stimuli remains obscure. Here, we report the crystal structure of a complete cytoplasmic portion of an SK, VicK from Streptococcus mutans. The overall structure of VicK is a long-rod dimer that anchors four connected domains: HAMP, Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS), DHp, and catalytic and ATP binding domain (CA). The HAMP, a signal transducer, and the PAS domain, major sensor, adopt canonical folds with dyad symmetry. In contrast, the dimer of the DHp and CA domains is asymmetric because of different helical bends in the DHp domain and spatial positions of the CA domains. Moreover, a conserved proline, which is adjacent to the phosphoryl acceptor histidine, contributes to helical bending, which is essential for the autokinase and phosphatase activities. Together, the elegant architecture of VicK with a signal transducer and sensor domain suggests a model where DHp helical bending and a CA swing movement are likely coordinated for autokinase activation.},

abstract = {Motivation: Biological data and knowledge bases increasingly rely on Semantic Web technologies and the use of knowledge graphs for data integration, retrieval and federated queries. In the past years, feature learning methods that are applicable to graph-structured data are becoming available, but have not yet widely been applied and evaluated on structured biological knowledge. Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge graphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledge representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural networks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information within knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings contain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to the prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of function prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein interactions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that matches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually crafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph, and will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledge bases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics.

abstract = {A T-cell-mediated immune response is initiated by the T-cell receptor (TCR) interacting with peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on an infected cell. The mechanism by which this interaction triggers intracellular phosphorylation of the TCR, which lacks a kinase domain, remains poorly understood. Here, we have introduced the TCR and associated signalling molecules into a non-immune cell and reconstituted ligand-specific signalling when these cells are conjugated with antigen-presenting cells. We show that signalling requires the differential segregation of a phosphatase and kinase in the plasma membrane. An artificial, chemically controlled receptor system generates the same effect as TCR–pMHC, demonstrating that the binding energy of an extracellular protein–protein interaction can drive the spatial segregation of membrane proteins without a transmembrane conformational change. This general mechanism may extend to other receptors that rely on extrinsic kinases, including, as we demonstrate, chimaeric antigen receptors being developed for cancer immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Agin1g has been associated with a progressive decline of proteostasis, but how this process affects proteome composition remains largely unexplored. Here, we profiled more than 5,000 proteins along the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans. We find that one-third of proteins change in abundance at least 2-fold during aging, resulting in a severe proteome imbalance. These changes are reduced in the long-lived daf-2 mutant but are enhanced in the short-lived daf-16 mutant. While ribosomal proteins decline and lose normal stoichiometry, proteasome complexes increase. Proteome imbalance is accompanied by widespread protein aggregation, with abundant proteins that exceed solubility contributing most to aggregate load. Notably, the properties by which proteins are selected for aggregation differ in the daf-2 mutant, and an increased formation of aggregates associated with small heat-shock proteins is observed. We suggest that sequestering proteins into chaperone-enriched aggregates is a protective strategy to slow proteostasis decline during nematode aging.},

Each scaffold protein oligomerizes procaspases into a complex called the apoptosome, but the regulation and biological roles of the scaffolds differ. Whereas CED-4 is restrained by the Bcl-2 homologue CED-9, Apaf-1 is inhibited by its WD40 repeat region, until it is activated by cytochrome c, derived from damaged mitochondria. Although Dark also has a WD40 region, its activation does not seem to involve cytochrome c. CED-4 is essential for apoptosis in the worm and Dark for many apoptotic responses in the fly, but the Apaf-1/caspase-9 system probably amplifies rather than initiates the mammalian caspase cascade.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the maximally achievable acceleration factor, fully acquired cine data, obtained in sham and chronically infarcted (MI) mouse hearts were 2-4-fold undersampled retrospectively, followed by CS reconstruction and blinded image segmentation. Subsequently, dedicated CS sampling schemes were implemented at a preclinical 9.4 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, and 2- and 3-fold undersampled cine data were acquired in normal mouse hearts with high temporal and spatial resolution. RESULTS: The retrospective analysis demonstrated that an undersampling factor of three is feasible without impairing accuracy of cardiac functional parameters. Dedicated CS sampling schemes applied prospectively to normal mouse hearts yielded comparable left-ventricular functional parameters, and intra- and interobserver variability between fully and 3-fold undersampled data.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter sodium symporters are integral membrane proteins that remove chemical transmitters from the synapse and terminate neurotransmission mediated by serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glycine and GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid). Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances.},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

Despite six decades of progress, state-of-the-art techniques cannot annotate 1/3 of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit sequences collected from diverse organisms. To address this, we report a deep learning model that learns the relationship between unaligned amino acid sequences and their functional classification across all 17929 families of the Pfam database. Using the Pfam seed sequences we establish a rigorous benchmark assessment and find a dilated convolutional model that reduces the error of both BLASTp and pHMMs by a factor of nine. Using 80{\%} of the full Pfam database we train a protein family predictor that is more accurate and over 200 times faster than BLASTp, while learning sequence features it was not trained on such as structural disorder and transmembrane helices. Our model co-locates sequences from unseen families in embedding space, allowing sequences from novel families to be accurately annotated. These results suggest deep learning models will be a core component of future protein function prediction tools.},

Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.},

abstract = {Several pathogenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutations have been described, all of which cause increased amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) levels. Here we present studies of a pathogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation, located within the A$\beta$ sequence at codon 693 (E693G), that causes AD in a Swedish family. Carriers of this 'Arctic' mutation showed decreased A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 levels in plasma. Additionally, low levels of A$\beta$42 were detected in conditioned media from cells transfected with APPE693G. Fibrillization studies demonstrated no difference in fibrillization rate, but A$\beta$ with the Arctic mutation formed protofibrils at a much higher rate and in larger quantities than wild-type (wt) A$\beta$. The finding of increased protofibril formation and decreased A$\beta$ plasma levels in the Arctic AD may reflect an alternative pathogenic mechanism for AD involving rapid A$\beta$ protofibril formation leading to accelerated buildup of insoluble A$\beta$ intra- and/or extracellularly.},

abstract = {The CD1 family is a large cluster of non-polymorphic, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I-like molecules that bind distinct lipid-based antigens that are recognized by T cells. The most studied group of T cells that interact with lipid antigens are natural killer T (NKT) cells, which characteristically express a semi-invariant T-cell receptor (NKT TCR) that specifically recognizes the CD1 family member, CD1d. NKT-cell-mediated recognition of the CD1d-antigen complex has been implicated in microbial immunity, tumour immunity, autoimmunity and allergy. Here we describe the structure of a human NKT TCR in complex with CD1d bound to the potent NKT-cell agonist alpha-galactosylceramide, the archetypal CD1d-restricted glycolipid. In contrast to T-cell receptor-peptide-antigen-MHC complexes, the NKT TCR docked parallel to, and at the extreme end of the CD1d-binding cleft, which enables a lock-and-key type interaction with the lipid antigen. The structure provides a basis for the interaction between the highly conserved NKT TCR alpha-chain and the CD1d-antigen complex that is typified in innate immunity, and also indicates how variability of the NKT TCR beta-chain can impact on recognition of other CD1d-antigen complexes. These findings provide direct insight into how a T-cell receptor recognizes a lipid-antigen-presenting molecule of the immune system.},

abstract = {Integrins are the major cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix molecules, which play critical roles in a variety of biological processes. Focal adhesion kinase has recently been established as a key component of the signal transduction pathways triggered by integrins. Aggregation of FAK with integrins and cytoskeletal proteins in focal contacts has been proposed to be responsible for FAK activation and autophosphorylation by integrins in cell adhesion. This may be achieved by FAK interaction with talin or other cytoskeletal proteins that in turn associate with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin beta subunits. Autophosphorylation of FAK at Y397 leads to its association with Src, resulting in activation of both kinases. The activated FAK/Src complex acts on potential substrates tensin, paxillin and p130cas. Besides cytoskeletal regulation, FAK phosphorylation and/or binding to paxillin and p130cas may trigger downstream activation of MAP kinase by the adoptor protein Crk. Src association with FAK may also lead to its phosphorylation of other sites on FAK, including a binding site for Grb2. Cell adhesion-dependent association of FAK and Grb2 may provide a mechanism by which MAP kinase is activated in cell adhesion. PI 3-kinase has also been shown to bind FAK in a cell adhesion-dependent manner at the major autophosphorylation site Y397. This association could lead to activation of PI 3-kinase and its downstream effectors. Recent results from a number of different approaches have shown that integrin signaling through FAK leads to increased cell migration on fibronectin as well as potentially regulating cell proliferation and survival.},

abstract = {As organisms age, the effectiveness of natural selection weakens, leading to age-related decline in fitness-related traits. The evolution of age-related changes associated with senescence is likely influenced by mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). MA predicts that age-related decline in fitness components is driven by age-specific sets of alleles, nonnegative genetic correlations within trait across age, and an increase in the coefficient of genetic variance. AP predicts that age-related decline in a trait is driven by alleles with positive effects on fitness in young individuals and negative effects in old individuals, and is expected to lead to negative genetic correlations within traits across age. We build on these predictions using an association mapping approach to investigate the change in additive effects of SNPs across age and among traits for multiple stress-response fitness-related traits, including cold stress with and without acclimation and starvation resistance. We found support for both MA and AP theories of aging in the age-related decline in stress tolerance. Our study demonstrates that the evolution of age-related decline in stress tolerance is driven by a combination of alleles that have age-specific additive effects, consistent with MA, as well as nonindependent and antagonistic genetic architectures characteristic of AP.},

abstract = {Based on the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor structure, Unwin and colleagues (Miyazawa et al., 2003; Unwin, 2005) hypothesized that the transduction of agonist binding to channel gate opening involves a "pin-into-socket" interaction between alphaV46 at the tip of the extracellular beta1-beta2 loop and the transmembrane M2 segment and M2-M3 loop. We mutated to cysteine the aligned positions in the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunit beta1-beta2 loops K81 and Q70, respectively. The maximal 5-HT-activated currents in receptors containing 5-HT3A/K81C or 5-HT3B/Q70C were markedly reduced compared with wild type. Desensitization of wild-type currents involved fast and slow components. Mutant currents desensitized with only the fast time constant. Reaction with several methanethiosulfonate reagents potentiated currents to wild-type levels, but reaction with other more rigid thiol-reactive reagents caused inhibition. Single-channel conductances of wild type, K81C, and K81C after modification were similar. We tested the proximity of K81C to the M2-M3 loop by mutating M2-M3 loop residues to cysteine in the K81C background. Disulfide bonds formed in 5-HT3A/K81C/A304C and 5-HT3A/K81C/I305C when coexpressed with 5-HT3B. We conclude that in the resting state, K81 is not in a hydrophobic pocket as suggested by the pin-into-socket hypothesis. K81 interacts with the extracellular end of M2 and plays a critical role in channel opening and in the return from fast desensitization. We suggest that during channel activation, beta1-beta2 loop movement moves M2 and the M2-M3 loop so that the M2 segments rotate/translate away from the channel axis, thereby opening the lumen. Recovery from fast desensitization requires the interaction between K81 and the extracellular end of M2.},

@article{Brody2011,
abstract = {RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation. Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation. How Pol II elongation rates are influenced by splicing is not well understood. We generated a family of inducible gene constructs containing increasing numbers of introns and exons, which were stably integrated in human cells to serve as actively transcribing gene loci. By monitoring the association of the transcription and splicing machineries on these genes in vivo, we showed that only U1 snRNP localized to the intronless gene, consistent with a splicing-independent role for U1 snRNP in transcription. In contrast, all snRNPs accumulated on intron-containing genes, and increasing the number of introns increased the amount of spliceosome components recruited. This indicates that nascent RNA can assemble multiple spliceosomes simultaneously. Kinetic measurements of Pol II elongation in vivo, Pol II ChIP, as well as use of Spliceostatin and Meayamycin splicing inhibitors showed that polymerase elongation rates were uncoupled from ongoing splicing. This study shows that transcription elongation kinetics proceed independently of splicing at the model genes studied here. Surprisingly, retention of polyadenylated mRNA was detected at the transcription site after transcription termination. This suggests that the polymerase is released from chromatin prior to the completion of splicing, and the pre-mRNA is post-transcriptionally processed while still tethered to chromatin near the gene end.},

This situation has prompted the design of alternative surfactants that can be substituted for detergents once target proteins have been extracted from biological membranes and that keep them soluble in aqueous buffers while stabilizing them. The present review focuses on three such systems: Amphipols (APols) are amphipathic polymers that adsorb onto the hydrophobic transmembrane surface of MPs; nanodiscs (NDs) are small patches of lipid bilayer whose rim is stabilized by amphipathic proteins; fluorinated surfactants (FSs) resemble detergents but interfere less than detergents do with stabilizing protein/protein and protein/lipid interactions. The structure and properties of each of these three systems are described, as well as those of the complexes they form with MPs. Their respective usefulness, constraints, and prospects for functional and structural studies of MPs are discussed.},

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

abstract = {Numerous disease-associated point mutations exert their effects by disrupting the activity of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). We previously derived position weight matrices to predict putative ESEs specific for four human SR proteins. The score matrices are part of ESEfinder, an online resource to identify ESEs in query sequences. We have now carried out a refined functional SELEX screen for motifs that can act as ESEs in response to the human SR protein SF2/ASF. The test BRCA1 exon under selection was internal, rather than the 3'-terminal IGHM exon used in our earlier studies. A naturally occurring heptameric ESE in BRCA1 exon 18 was replaced with two libraries of random sequences, one seven nucleotides in length, the other 14. Following three rounds of selection for in vitro splicing via internal exon inclusion, new consensus motifs and score matrices were derived. Many winner sequences were demonstrated to be functional ESEs in S100-extract-complementation assays with recombinant SF2/ASF. Motif-score threshold values were derived from both experimental and statistical analyses. Motif scores were shown to correlate with levels of exon inclusion, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm and extend our earlier data, as many of the same motifs are recognized as ESEs by both the original and our new score matrix, despite the different context used for selection. Finally, we have derived an increased specificity score matrix that incorporates information from both of our SF2/ASF-specific matrices and that accurately predicts the exon-skipping phenotypes of deleterious point mutations.},

abstract = {TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are bacterial outer membrane proteins that bind and transport ferric chelates, called siderophores, as well as vitamin B(12), nickel complexes, and carbohydrates. The transport process requires energy in the form of proton motive force and a complex of three inner membrane proteins, TonB-ExbB-ExbD, to transduce this energy to the outer membrane. The siderophore substrates range in complexity from simple small molecules such as citrate to large proteins such as serum transferrin and hemoglobin. Because iron uptake is vital for almost all bacteria, expression of TBDTs is regulated in a number of ways that include metal-dependent regulators, $\sigma$/anti-$\sigma$ factor systems, small RNAs, and even a riboswitch. In recent years, many new structures of TBDTs have been solved in various states, resulting in a more complete understanding of siderophore selectivity and binding, signal transduction across the outer membrane, and interaction with the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex. However, the transport mechanism is still unclear. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding regulation, structure, and function in TBDTs and questions remaining to be answered.},

abstract = {Glucose hypometabolism is a prominent feature of the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease progression is associated with a reduction in glucose transporters in both neurons and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. However, whether increasing glucose transport into either of these cell types offers therapeutic potential remains unknown. Using an adult-onset Drosophila model of A$\beta$ (amyloid beta) toxicity, we show that genetic overexpression of a glucose transporter, specifically in neurons, rescues lifespan, behavioral phenotypes, and neuronal morphology. This amelioration of A$\beta$ toxicity is associated with a reduction in the protein levels of the unfolded protein response (UPR) negative master regulator Grp78 and an increase in the UPR. We further demonstrate that genetic downregulation of Grp78 activity also protects against A$\beta$ toxicity, confirming a causal effect of its alteration on AD-related pathology. Metformin, a drug that stimulates glucose uptake in cells, mimicked these effects, with a concomitant reduction in Grp78 levels and rescue of the shortened lifespan and climbing defects of A$\beta$-expressing flies. Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of increased neuronal uptake of glucose against A$\beta$ toxicity and highlight Grp78 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.},

abstract = {Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of antibodies with the potency of small molecules to create targeted drugs. Despite the simplicity of this concept, generation of clinically successful ADCs has been very difficult. Over the past several decades, scientists have learned a great deal about the constraints on antibodies, linkers, and drugs as they relate to successful construction of ADCs. Once these components are in hand, most ADCs are prepared by nonspecific modification of antibody lysine or cysteine residues with drug-linker reagents, which results in heterogeneous product mixtures that cannot be further purified. With advances in the fields of bioorthogonal chemistry and protein engineering, there is growing interest in producing ADCs by site-specific conjugation to the antibody, yielding more homogeneous products that have demonstrated benefits over their heterogeneous counterparts in vivo. Here, we chronicle the development of a multitude of site-specific conjugation strategies for assembly of ADCs and provide a comprehensive account of key advances and their roots in the fields of bioorthogonal chemistry and protein engineering.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have greatly increased the identification of mutations in cancer genomes. However, it remains a significant challenge to identify cancer-driving mutations, since most observed missense changes are neutral passenger mutations. Various computational methods have been developed to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function and classify mutations as deleterious or benign. These include approaches that rely on evolutionary conservation, structural constraints, or physicochemical attributes of amino acid substitutions. Here we review existing methods and further examine eight tools: SIFT, PolyPhen2, Condel, CHASM, mCluster, logRE, SNAP, and MutationAssessor, with respect to their coverage, accuracy, availability and dependence on other tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms with high minor allele frequencies were used as a negative (neutral) set for testing, and recurrent mutations from the COSMIC database as well as novel recurrent somatic mutations identified in very recent cancer studies were used as positive (non-neutral) sets. Conservation-based methods generally had moderately high accuracy in distinguishing neutral from deleterious mutations, whereas the performance of machine learning based predictors with comprehensive feature spaces varied between assessments using different positive sets. MutationAssessor consistently provided the highest accuracies. For certain combinations metapredictors slightly improved the performance of included individual methods, but did not outperform MutationAssessor as stand-alone tool.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our independent assessment of existing tools reveals various performance disparities. Cancer-trained methods did not improve upon more general predictors. No method or combination of methods exceeds 81{\%} accuracy, indicating there is still significant room for improvement for driver mutation prediction, and perhaps more sophisticated feature integration is needed to develop a more robust tool.},

abstract = {There is a limited repertoire of domain families that are duplicated and combined in different ways to form the set of proteins in a genome. Proteins are gene products, and at the level of genes, duplication, recombination, fusion and fission are the processes that produce new genes. We attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying the evolutionary units in proteins, domains, in the protein sequences of 40 genomes. The domain and superfamily definitions in the Structural Classification of Proteins Database are used, so that we can view all pairs of adjacent domains in genome sequences in terms of their superfamily combinations. We find 783 out of the 859 superfamilies in SCOP in these genomes, and the 783 families occur in 1307 pairwise combinations. Most families are observed in combination with one or two other families, while a few families are very versatile in their combinatorial behaviour; 209 families do not make combinations with other families. This type of pattern can be described as a scale-free network. We also study the N to C-terminal orientation of domain pairs and domain repeats. The phylogenetic distribution of domain combinations is surveyed, to establish the extent of common and kingdom-specific combinations. Of the kingdom-specific combinations, significantly more combinations consist of families present in all three kingdoms than of families present in one or two kingdoms. Hence, we are led to conclude that recombination between common families, as compared to the invention of new families and recombination among these, has also been a major contribution to the evolution of kingdom-specific and species-specific functions in organisms in all three kingdoms. Finally, we compare the set of the domain combinations in the genomes to those in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and discuss the implications for structural genomics. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

Strong synergy arises between these two techniques because of their ability to ascertain complementary information about gas-phase ions. Ion mobility separates ions (from small molecules up to megadalton protein complexes) based on their differential mobility through a buffer gas. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) can thus act as a tool to separate complex mixtures, to resolve ions that may be indistinguishable by mass spectrometry alone, or to determine structural information (for example rotationally averaged cross-sectional area), complementary to more traditional structural approaches. Finally, IM-MS can be used to gain insights into the conformational dynamics of a system, offering a unique means of characterizing flexibility and folding mechanisms. This Review critically describes how IM-MS has been used to enhance various areas of chemical and biophysical analysis.},

Although there is a general tendency that proteins with a smaller number of transmembrane segments are more prevalent than those with many, uni-cellular organisms appear to prefer proteins with 6 and 12 transmembrane segments, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens have a slight preference for proteins with seven transmembrane segments. In all organisms, there is a tendency that membrane proteins either have many transmembrane segments with short connecting loops or few transmembrane segments with large extra-membraneous domains. Membrane proteins from all organisms studied, except possibly the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, follow the so-called "positive-inside" rule; i.e., they tend to have a higher frequency of positively charged residues in cytoplasmic than in extra-cytoplasmic segments.},

Protein function prediction has been a long standing challenge to fill the gap between the huge amount of protein sequences and the known function. In this paper, we propose a novel method to convert the protein function problem into a language translation problem by the new proposed protein sequence language "ProLan" to the protein function language "GOLan", and build a neural machine translation model based on recurrent neural networks to translate "ProLan" language to "GOLan" language. We blindly tested our method by attending the latest third Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA 3) in 2016, and also evaluate the performance of our methods on selected proteins whose function was released after CAFA competition. The good performance on the training and testing datasets demonstrates that our new proposed method is a promising direction for protein function prediction. In summary, we first time propose a method which converts the protein function prediction problem to a language translation problem and applies a neural machine translation model for protein function prediction.},

abstract = {The mechanism of DNA replication is one of the driving forces of genome evolution. Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC contains two domains, the 3'-5'exonuclease domain and the polymerase domain, while DnaE only possesses the polymerase domain. Accordingly, DnaE does not have the proofreading function; in Escherichia coli, another enzyme DnaQ performs this function. In most bacteria, the fidelity of DNA replication is maintained by 3'-5' exonuclease and a mismatch repair (MMR) system. However, we found that most Actinobacteria (a group of Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content) appear to have lost the MMR system and chromosomes may be replicated by DnaE-type DNA polymerase III with DnaQ-like 3'-5' exonuclease. We tested the mutation bias of Bacillus subtilis, which belongs to the Firmicutes and found that the wild type strain is AT-biased while the mutS-deletant strain is remarkably GC-biased. If we presume that DnaE tends to make mistakes that increase GC content, these results can be explained by the mutS deletion (i.e., deletion of the MMR system). Thus, we propose that GC content is regulated by DNA polymerase and MMR system, and the absence of polC genes, which participate in the MMR system, may be the reason for the increase of GC content in Gram-positive bacteria such as Actinobacteria.},

Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a GABAAR, the human $\beta$3 homopentamer, at 3 {\AA} resolution. This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABAAR modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state. These results offer new insights into the signalling mechanisms of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and enhance current understanding of GABAergic neurotransmission.},

abstract = {Glutamate, released at a majority of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, depolarizes neurons by acting at specific receptors. Its action is terminated by removal from the synaptic cleft mostly via Na(+)-dependent uptake systems located on both neurons and astrocytes. Here we report that glutamate, in addition to its receptor-mediated actions on neuronal excitability, stimulates glycolysis--i.e., glucose utilization and lactate production--in astrocytes. This metabolic action is mediated by activation of a Na(+)-dependent uptake system and not by interaction with receptors. The mechanism involves the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, which is activated by an increase in the intracellular concentration of Na+ cotransported with glutamate by the electrogenic uptake system. Thus, when glutamate is released from active synapses and taken up by astrocytes, the newly identified signaling pathway described here would provide a simple and direct mechanism to tightly couple neuronal activity to glucose utilization. In addition, glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is consistent with data obtained from functional brain imaging studies indicating local nonoxidative glucose utilization during physiological activation.},

Now we describe GeneMark-EP, a tool that utilizes another source of external information, a protein database, readily available prior to a start of a sequencing project. The new algorithm and software tool integrate information produced by proteins spliced aligned to genomic regions into model training and gene prediction steps. A specialized pipeline, ProtHint, makes processing the results of mapping of multiple proteins to a genomic region where a protein from the same family is likely encoded. GeneMark-EP uses the hints from ProtHint to improve estimation of model parameters as well as to adjust co-ordinates of predicted genes if they disagree with the most reliable hints (the -EP+ mode). Tests conducted with GeneMark-EP and -EP+ have demonstrated that the gene prediction accuracy is higher than one of GeneMark-ES, particularly in large eukaryotic genomes.},

abstract = {CD1 molecules function to present lipid-based antigens to T cells. Here we present the crystal structure of CD1c at 2.5 {\AA} resolution, in complex with the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen mannosyl-$\beta$1-phosphomycoketide (MPM). CD1c accommodated MPM's methylated alkyl chain exclusively in the A' pocket, aided by a unique exit portal underneath the $\alpha$1 helix. Most striking was an open F' pocket architecture lacking the closed cavity structure of other CD1 molecules, reminiscent of peptide binding grooves of classical major histocompatibility complex molecules. This feature, combined with tryptophan-fluorescence quenching during loading of a dodecameric lipopeptide antigen, provides a compelling model by which both the lipid and peptide moieties of the lipopeptide are involved in CD1c presentation of lipopeptides.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (Abeta)-containing plaques are surrounded by dystrophic neurites in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, but whether and how plaques induce these neuritic abnormalities remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that soluble oligomeric assemblies of Abeta, which surround plaques, induce calcium-mediated secondary cascades that lead to dystrophic changes in local neurites. We show that soluble Abeta oligomers lead to activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) (PP2B), which in turn activates the transcriptional factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Activation of these signaling pathways, even in the absence of Abeta, is sufficient to produce a virtual phenocopy of Abeta-induced dystrophic neurites, dendritic simplification, and dendritic spine loss in both neurons in culture and in the adult mouse brain. Importantly, the morphological deficits in the vicinity of Abeta deposits in a mouse model of AD are ameliorated by CaN inhibition, supporting the hypothesis that CaN-NFAT are aberrantly activated by Abeta and that CaN-NFAT activation is responsible for disruption of neuronal structure near plaques. In accord with this, we also detect increased levels of an active form of CaN and NFATc4 in the nuclear fraction from the cortex of patients with AD. Thus, Abeta appears to mediate the neurodegeneration of AD, at least in part, by activation of CaN and subsequent NFAT-mediated downstream cascades.},

However, it has not been known whether APP exerts intracellular signaling functions in living cells. In this study, we show that stimulation of APP by anti-APP antibody as well as by a mutation found in familial Alzheimer's disease results in activation of a specific set of mitogen-activated protein kinases in multiple vertebrate cells. We conclude that APP acts as a cell surface receptor of biological relevance that turns on specific Ser/Thr kinases, and suggest that the signaling function of APP is a potential target of familial Alzheimer's disease mutations},

@article{Zhou2014,
abstract = {Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes and secreted through the biliary tract into the small intestine, where they aid in absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Through a process known as enterohepatic recirculation, more than 90{\%} of secreted bile acids are then retrieved from the intestine and returned to the liver for resecretion. In humans, there are two Na(+)-dependent bile acid transporters involved in enterohepatic recirculation, the Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; also known as SLC10A1) expressed in hepatocytes, and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT; also known as SLC10A2) expressed on enterocytes in the terminal ileum. In recent years, ASBT has attracted much interest as a potential drug target for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, because inhibition of ASBT reduces reabsorption of bile acids, thus increasing bile acid synthesis and consequently cholesterol consumption. However, a lack of three-dimensional structures of bile acid transporters hampers our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and transport, and to interpret the wealth of existing functional data. The crystal structure of an ASBT homologue from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) in detergent was reported recently, showing the protein in an inward-open conformation bound to two Na(+) and a taurocholic acid. However, the structural changes that bring bile acid and Na(+) across the membrane are difficult to infer from a single structure. To understand the structural changes associated with the coupled transport of Na(+) and bile acids, here we solved two structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii (ASBTYf) in a lipid environment, which reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of a substrate-binding domain gives the conserved 'crossover' region, where two discontinuous helices cross each other, alternating accessibility from either side of the cell membrane. This result has implications for the location and orientation of the bile acid during transport, as well as for the translocation pathway for Na(+).},

abstract = {A method of protein structure comparison developed previously is extended to incorporate other aspects of protein structure in addition to the inter-atomic vectors on which it was originally based. Each additional aspect, which included hydrogen bonding, solvent exposure, torsional angles and sequence, was introduced separately and evaluated for its ability to improve alignment quality. The components were then combined, suitably weighted, to produce a more holistic comparison method. The method was tested on a group of remotely related $\beta$/$\alpha$ type proteins that share a common feature in their overall chain fold. The results indicated that while the original inter-atomic vector component was sufficient to give the correct alignment of most pairs of topologically equivalent proteins, the inclusion of hydrogen bonds, torsion angles and a measure of solvent exposure led to improvements in the more difficult comparisons. Consideration of amino acid properties, including hydrophobicity, had no beneficial effect. The failure of the latter component was not unexpected considering the almost total lack of sequence similarity among the proteins considered. {\textcopyright} 1989 IRL Press at Oxford University Press.},

USA 76, 4530-4533] to insert the lactose structural genes randomly into the bacterial chromosome. Induction of beta-galactosidase in these strains, which carried fusions of lac to these din (damage-inducible) loci, was (i) triggered by UV light as well as by mitomycin C and (ii) abolished by either a recA- or a lexA- mutation. Similar characteristics of induction were observed when the lactose genes were fused to a prophage lambda promoter by using Mud(ApR, lac). These results indicate that E. coli contains a set of genes that, like prophage lambda genes, are expressed in response to DNA-damaging agents and regulated by the recA and lexA gene products. These din genes map at five bacterial loci. One din::Mud(ApR, lac) insertion results in a UV-sensitive phenotype and may be within the uvrA transcriptional unit.},

abstract = {Complex I is the first and largest enzyme of the respiratory chain and has a central role in cellular energy production through the coupling of NADH:ubiquinone electron transfer to proton translocation. It is also implicated in many common human neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the entire, intact complex I (from Thermus thermophilus) at 3.3 {\AA} resolution. The structure of the 536-kDa complex comprises 16 different subunits, with a total of 64 transmembrane helices and 9 iron-sulphur clusters. The core fold of subunit Nqo8 (ND1 in humans) is, unexpectedly, similar to a half-channel of the antiporter-like subunits. Small subunits nearby form a linked second half-channel, which completes the fourth proton-translocation pathway (present in addition to the channels in three antiporter-like subunits). The quinone-binding site is unusually long, narrow and enclosed. The quinone headgroup binds at the deep end of this chamber, near iron-sulphur cluster N2. Notably, the chamber is linked to the fourth channel by a 'funnel' of charged residues. The link continues over the entire membrane domain as a flexible central axis of charged and polar residues, and probably has a leading role in the propagation of conformational changes, aided by coupling elements. The structure suggests that a unique, out-of-the-membrane quinone-reaction chamber enables the redox energy to drive concerted long-range conformational changes in the four antiporter-like domains, resulting in translocation of four protons per cycle.},

abstract = {Background: Metagenomics has become a prominent approach for exploring the role of the gut microbiota in human health. However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject. Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by the preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36{\%} of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods. Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria characteristically are surrounded by an additional membrane layer, the outer membrane. Although outer membrane components often play important roles in the interaction of symbiotic or pathogenic bacteria with their host organisms, the major role of this membrane must usually be to serve as a permeability barrier to prevent the entry of noxious compounds and at the same time to allow the influx of nutrient molecules. This review summarizes the development in the field since our previous review (H. Nikaido and M. Vaara, Microbiol. Rev. 49:1-32, 1985) was published. With the discovery of protein channels, structural knowledge enables us to understand in molecular detail how porins, specific channels, TonB-linked receptors, and other proteins function. We are now beginning to see how the export of large proteins occurs across the outer membrane. With our knowledge of the lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid asymmetric bilayer of the outer membrane, we are finally beginning to understand how this bilayer can retard the entry of lipophilic compounds, owing to our increasing knowledge about the chemistry of lipopolysaccharide from diverse organisms and the way in which lipopolysaccharide structure is modified by environmental conditions.},

Here we show that growth factors induce rRNA synthesis by activating MAPK-dependent signaling cascades that target the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor TIF-IA. Activation of TIF-IA and ribosomal gene transcription is sensitive to PD98059, indicating that TIF-IA is targeted by MAPK in vivo. Phosphopeptide mapping and mutational analysis reveals two serine residues (S633 and S649) that are phosphorylated by ERK and RSK kinases. Replacement of S649 by alanine inactivates TIF-IA, inhibits pre-rRNA synthesis, and retards cell growth. The results provide a link between growth factor signaling, ribosome production, and cell growth, and may have a major impact on the mechanism of cell transformation.},

abstract = {The disulfides in three monoclonal antibodies (mAb), the anti-HER2, anti-CD11a, and GLP-1 with IgG4-Fc fusion protein, were completely mapped by LC-MS with the combination of electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) and collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation. In addition to mapping the 4 inter- and 12 intrachain disulfides (total 16), the identification of scrambled disulfides in degraded samples (heat-stress) was achieved. The scrambling was likely attributed to an initial breakage between the light (Cys 214) and heavy (Cys 223) chains in anti-HER2, with the same observation found in a similar therapeutic mAb, anti-CD11a. On the other hand, the fusion antibody, with no light chain but containing only two heavy chains, generated much less scrambling under the same heat-stressed conditions. The preferred sites of scrambling were identified, such as the intrachain disulfide for CxxC in the heavy chain, and the C194 of the heavy chain pairing with the terminal Cys residue (C214) in the light chain. The interchain disulfides between the light and heavy chains were weaker than the interchain disulfides between the two heavy chains. The relative high abundance ions observed in ETD provided strong evidence for the linked peptide information, which was particularly useful for the identification of the scrambled disulfides. The use of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) helped the separation of these misfolded proteins for the determination of scrambled disulfide linkages. This methodology is useful for comparison of disulfide stability generated from different structural designs and providing a new way to determine the scrambling patterns, which could be applied for those seeking to determine unknown disulfide linkages.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {To better understand splicing regulation, we used a cell-based screen to identify ten diverse motifs that inhibit splicing from introns. Motifs were validated in another human cell type and gene context, and their presence correlated with in vivo splicing changes. All motifs exhibited exonic splicing enhancer or silencer activity, and grouping these motifs according to their distributions yielded clusters with distinct patterns of context-dependent activity. Candidate regulatory factors associated with each motif were identified, to recover 24 known and new splicing regulators. Specific domains in selected factors were sufficient to confer intronic-splicing-silencer activity. Many factors bound multiple distinct motifs with similar affinity, and all motifs were recognized by multiple factors, which revealed a complex overlapping network of protein-RNA interactions. This arrangement enables individual cis elements to function differently in distinct cellular contexts, depending on the spectrum of regulatory factors present.},

Traditionally, network biology has ignored such properties of proteins and has instead examined either the physical interactions of whole proteins or the consequences of removing entire genes. In this Review, we discuss experimental and computational methods to increase the resolution of protein-protein, genetic and drug-gene interaction studies to the domain and residue levels. Such work will be crucial for using interaction networks to connect sequence and structural information, and to understand the biological consequences of disease-associated mutations, which will hopefully lead to more effective therapeutic strategies.},

The many unresolved issues include the role of the amino-terminal domain in AMPA receptor signaling and the mechanisms by which auxiliary proteins regulate receptor activity.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Bentham Science Publishers. Background: DNA topoisomerase II$\beta$ (topo II$\beta$) plays a crucial role in neural differentiation and axonogenesis. Inhibition of topo II$\beta$ activity in vitro and in vivo results in shorter axons and increased DNA damage. These molecular events also involve in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the role of topo II$\beta$ in the pathogenesis of AD remains to be elucidated. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the role of topo II$\beta$ association with Nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1) in the onset of AD. Methods: In vitro AD model was established by the incubation of fibrillar amyloid-$\beta$ 1-42 (A$\beta$1-42) for 48 hours with cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) isolated from post-natal eight-day rats. The regulatory role of topo II$\beta$ on the transcription of Nurr1 was analyzed in topo II$\beta$ silenced CGNs, and also topo II$\beta$ silenced and overexpressed in a neurally-differentiated human mesenchymal (hMSC) cell line. Results: A$\beta$1-42fibrils led to the upregulation of Presenilin1 and Cofilin1 genes as measured at mRNA levels and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, all are distinctive characteristics of AD pathology. A significant decrease in topo II$\beta$ expression at mRNA and protein levels and Nurr1 at mRNA level was also observed. In both cell types, Nurr1 expression was dramatically down-regulated due to topo II$\beta$ deficiency, and was increased in topo II$\beta$ overexpressing hMSCs. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that topo II$\beta$ could be a down-stream target of signaling pathways contributing to AD-like pathology. However, further studies must be carried out in vivo to elucidate the precise association topo II$\beta$ with AD.},

Recently, proton motive force (pmf) has been found to be necessary for the co-precipitation of the outer membrane lipoprotein Pal with the inner membrane TolA protein, indicating that the Tol-Pal system forms a transmembrane link in which TolA is energized. In this study, we show that both TolQ and TolR proteins are essential for the TolA-Pal interaction. A point mutation within the third transmembrane (TM) segment of TolQ was found to affect the TolA-Pal interaction strongly, whereas suppressor mutations within the TM segment of TolR restored this interaction. Modifying the Asp residue within the TM region of TolR indicated that an acidic residue was important for the pmf-dependent interaction of TolA with Pal and outer membrane stabilization. Analysis of sequence alignments of TolQ and TolR homologues from numerous Gram-negative bacterial genomes, together with analyses of the different tolQ-tolR mutants, revealed that the TM domains of TolQ and TolR present structural and functional homologies not only to ExbB and ExbD of the TonB system but also with MotA and MotB of the flagellar motor.

Yet, given the incompleteness of the interactome and the limited knowledge of disease-associated genes, it is not obvious if the available data have sufficient coverage to map out modules associated with each disease. Here we derive mathematical conditions for the identifiability of disease modules and show that the network-based location of each disease module determines its pathobiological relationship to other diseases. For example, diseases with overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns, symptom similarity, and comorbidity, whereas diseases residing in separated network neighborhoods are phenotypically distinct. These tools represent an interactome-based platform to predict molecular commonalities between phenotypically related diseases, even if they do not share primary disease genes. $\backslash$nCopyright {\textcopyright} 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.},

Second, a rigid cluster normal-mode analysis provides low-frequency normal modes. Third, these modes are used to extend the recently introduced idea of constrained geometric simulations by biasing backbone motions of the protein, whereas side chain motions are biased toward favorable rotamer states (NMSim). The generated structures are iteratively corrected regarding steric clashes and stereochemical constraint violations. The approach allows performing three simulation types: unbiased exploration of conformational space; pathway generation by a targeted simulation; and radius of gyration-guided simulation. On a data set of proteins with experimentally observed conformational changes, the NMSim approach has been shown to be a computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for conformational sampling of proteins. The generated conformations and pathways of conformational transitions can serve as input to docking approaches or more sophisticated sampling techniques. The web server output is a trajectory of generated conformations, Jmol representations of the coarse-graining and a subset of the trajectory and data plots of structural analyses.

abstract = {Stochastic neurons and hard non-linearities can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic or non-smooth neurons? I.e., can we "back-propagate" through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing approaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different settings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for stochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second approach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic neuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which approximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first order. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative noise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth approach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic output directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid argument (we call this the straight-through estimator). To explore a context where these estimators are useful, we consider a small-scale version of {\{}$\backslash$em conditional computation{\}}, where sparse stochastic units form a distributed representation of gaters that can turn off in combinatorially many ways large chunks of the computation performed in the rest of the neural network. In this case, it is important that the gating units produce an actual 0 most of the time. The resulting sparsity can be potentially be exploited to greatly reduce the computational cost of large deep networks for which conditional computation would be useful.},

abstract = {The porins OmpF and OmpC are trimeric $\beta$-barrel proteins with narrow channels running through each monomer that exclude molecules {\textgreater} 600 Da while mediating the passive diffusion of small nutrients and metabolites across the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM). Here, we elucidate the mechanism by which an entire soluble protein domain ({\textgreater} 6 kDa) is delivered through the lumen of such porins. Following high-affinity binding to the vitamin B(12) receptor in Escherichia coli, the bacteriocin ColE9 recruits OmpF or OmpC using an 83-residue intrinsically unstructured translocation domain (IUTD) to deliver a 16-residue TolB-binding epitope (TBE) in the center of the IUTD to the periplasm where it triggers toxin entry. We demonstrate that the IUTD houses two OmpF-binding sites, OBS1 (residues 2-18) and OBS2 (residues 54-63), which flank the TBE and bind with K(d)s of 2 and 24 $\mu$M, respectively, at pH 6.5 and 25 {\textordmasculine}C. We show the two OBSs share the same binding site on OmpF and that the colicin must house at least one of them for antibiotic activity. Finally, we report the structure of the OmpF-OBS1 complex that shows the colicin bound within the porin lumen spanning the membrane bilayer. Our study explains how colicins exploit porins to deliver epitope signals to the bacterial periplasm and, more broadly, how the inherent flexibility and narrow cross-sectional area of an IUP domain can endow it with the ability to traverse a biological membrane via the constricted lumen of a $\beta$-barrel membrane protein.},

abstract = {The chimeric anti-CD30 IgG1, cAC10, conjugated to eight equivalents of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was previously shown to have potent antitumor activity against CD30-expressing tumors xenografts in mice. Moreover, the therapeutic index was increased by lowering the stoichiometry from 8 drugs/antibody down to 2 or 4. Limitations of such 'partially-loaded' conjugates are low yield (10-30{\%}) as they are purified from mixtures with variable stoichiometry (0-8 drugs/antibody), and heterogeneity as the 2 or 4 drugs are distributed over eight possible cysteine conjugation sites. Here, the solvent-accessible cysteines that form the interchain disulfide bonds in cAC10 were replaced with serine, to reduce the eight potential conjugation sites down to 4 or 2. These Cys--{\textgreater}Ser antibody variants were conjugated to MMAE in near quantitative yield (89-96{\%}) with defined stoichiometries (2 or 4 drugs/antibody) and sites of drug attachment. The engineered antibody-drug conjugates have comparable antigen-binding affinities and in vitro cytotoxic activities with corresponding purified parental antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, the engineered and parental antibody-drug conjugates have similar in vivo properties including antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose. Our strategy for generating antibody-drug conjugates with defined sites and stoichiometries of drug loading is potentially broadly applicable to other antibodies as it involves engineering of constant domains.},

@article{Shah2008,
abstract = {Motivation: As the amount of biological sequence data continues to grow exponentially we face the increasing challenge of assigning function to this enormous molecular 'parts list'. The most popular approaches to this challenge make use of the simplifying assumption that similar functional molecules, or proteins, sometimes have similar composition, or sequence. However, these algorithms often fail to identify remote homologs (proteins with similar function but dissimilar sequence) which often are a significant fraction of the total homolog collection for a given sequence. We introduce a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based tool to detect homology using semi-supervised iterative learning (SVM-HUSTLE) that identifies significantly more remote homologs than current state-of-the-art sequence or cluster-based methods. As opposed to building profiles or position specific scoring matrices, SVM-HUSTLE builds an SVM classifier for a query sequence by training on a collection of representative high-confidence training sets, recruits additional sequences and assigns a statistical measure of homology between a pair of sequences. SVM-HUSTLE combines principles of semi-supervised learning theory with statistical sampling to create many concurrent classifiers to iteratively detect and refine, on-the-fly, patterns indicating homology. Results: When compared against existing methods for identifying protein homologs (BLAST, PSI-BLAST, COMPASS, PROF{\_}SIM, RANKPROP and their variants) on two different benchmark datasets SVM-HUSTLE significantly outperforms each of the above methods using the most stringent ROC1 statistic with P -values less than 1e-20. SVM-HUSTLE also yields results comparable to HHSearch but at a substantially reduced computational cost since we do not require the construction of HMMs. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

Already, deep learning models can predict, with varying degrees of success, how genetic variation alters cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, which small molecules will modulate the activity of therapeutically relevant proteins, and whether radiographic images are indicative of disease. However, the flexibility of deep learning creates new challenges in guaranteeing the performance of deployed systems and in establishing trust with stakeholders, clinicians and regulators, who require a rationale for decision making. We argue that these challenges will be overcome using the same flexibility that created them; for example, by training deep models so that they can output a rationale for their predictions. Significant research in this direction will be needed to realize the full potential of deep learning in biomedicine.},

abstract = {Colicins are narrow-spectrum antibiotics produced by and active against Escherichia coli and its close relatives. Colicin-producing strains cannot coexist with sensitive or resistant strains in a well-mixed culture, yet all three phenotypes are recovered in natural populations. Recent in vitro results conclude that strain diversity can be promoted by colicin production in a spatially structured, non-transitive interaction, as in the classic non-transitive model rock-paper-scissors (RPS). In the colicin version of the RPS model, strains that produce colicins (C) kill sensitive (S) strains, which outcompete resistant (R) strains, which outcompete C strains. Pairwise in vitro competitions between these three strains are resolved in a predictable order (C beats S, S beats R, and R beats C), but the complete system of three strains presents the opportunity for dynamic equilibrium. Here we provide conclusive evidence of an in vivo antagonistic role for colicins and show that colicins (and potentially other bacteriocins) may promote, rather than eliminate, microbial diversity in the environment.},

abstract = {BetP, a trimeric Na(+)-coupled betaine symporter, senses hyperosmotic stress via its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain and regulates transport activity in dependence of the cytoplasmic K(+)-concentration. This transport regulation of BetP depends on a sophisticated interaction network. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy we structurally localize and quantify these interactions changing on K(+)-dependent transport activation and substrate-binding. K(+) significantly strengthened all interactions, modulated lifetimes of functionally important structural regions, and increased the mechanical rigidity of the symporter. Substrate-binding could modulate, but not establish most of these K(+)-dependent interactions. A pronounced effect triggered by K(+) was observed at the periplasmic helical loop EH2. Tryptophan quenching experiments revealed that elevated K(+)-concentrations akin to those BetP encounters during hyperosmotic stress trigger the formation of a periplasmic second betaine-binding (S2) site, which was found to be at a similar position reported previously for the BetP homologue CaiT. In BetP, the presence of the S2 site strengthened the interaction between EH2, transmembrane $\alpha$-helix 12 and the K(+)-sensing C-terminal domain resulting in a K(+)-dependent cooperative betaine-binding.},

We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various "no-flattening theorems" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that {\$}n{\$} variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2{\^{}}n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The differential expression analysis focusing on inter-group comparison can capture only differentially expressed genes (DE genes) at the population level, which may mask the heterogeneity of differential expression in individuals. Thus, to provide patient-specific information for personalized medicine, it is necessary to conduct differential expression analysis at the individual level.

RESULTS: We proposed a method to detect DE genes in individual disease samples by using the disrupted ordering in individual disease samples. In both simulated data and real paired cancer-normal sample data, this method showed excellent performance. It was found to be insensitive to experimental batch effects and data normalization. The landscape of stable gene pairs in a particular type of normal tissue could be predetermined using previously accumulated data, based on which dysregulated genes and pathways for any disease sample can be readily detected. The usefulness of the RankComp method in clinical settings was exemplified by the identification and application of prognostic markers for lung cancer.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: RankComp is implemented in R script that is freely available from Supplementary Materials.

abstract = {Transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is accompanied by conserved patterns of histone modification. Whereas histone modifications have established roles in transcription initiation, their functions during elongation are not understood. Mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification by promoting site-specific methylation of histone H3. H2Bub1 also regulates gene expression through an unidentified, methylation-independent mechanism. Here we reveal bidirectional communication between H2Bub1 and Cdk9, the ortholog of metazoan positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Chemical and classical genetic analyses indicate that lowering Cdk9 activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, the transcription processivity factor Spt5, reduces H2Bub1 in vivo. Conversely, mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. Moreover, an Spt5 phosphorylation-site mutation, combined with deletion of the histone H3 Lys4 methyltransferase Set1, phenocopies morphologic and growth defects due to H2Bub1 loss, suggesting independent, partially redundant roles for Cdk9 and Set1 downstream of H2Bub1. Surprisingly, mutation of the histone H2B ubiquitin-acceptor residue relaxes the Cdk9 activity requirement in vivo, and cdk9 mutations suppress cell-morphology defects in H2Bub1-deficient strains. Genome-wide analyses by chromatin immunoprecipitation also demonstrate opposing effects of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 on distribution of transcribing RNAPII. Therefore, whereas mutual dependence of H2Bub1 and Spt5 phosphorylation indicates positive feedback, mutual suppression by cdk9 and H2Bub1-pathway mutations suggests antagonistic functions that must be kept in balance to regulate elongation. Loss of H2Bub1 disrupts that balance and leads to deranged gene expression and aberrant cell morphologies, revealing a novel function of a conserved, co-transcriptional histone modification.},

abstract = {DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40) express dominant acting oncoproteins that exert their effects by associating with key cellular targets and altering the signaling pathways they govern. Thus, tumor viruses have proved to be invaluable aids in identifying proteins that participate in tumorigenesis, and in understanding the molecular basis for the transformed phenotype. The roles played by the SV40-encoded 708 amino-acid large T antigen (T antigen), and 174 amino acid small T antigen (t antigen), in transformation have been examined extensively. These studies have firmly established that large T antigen's inhibition of the p53 and Rb-family of tumor suppressors and small T antigen's action on the pp2A phosphatase, are important for SV40-induced transformation. It is not yet clear if the Rb, p53 and pp2A proteins are the only targets through which SV40 transforms cells, or whether additional targets await discovery. Finally, expression of SV40 oncoproteins in transgenic mice results in effects ranging from hyperplasia to invasive carcinoma accompanied by metastasis, depending on the tissue in which they are expressed. Thus, the consequences of SV40 action on these targets depend on the cell type being studied. The identification of additional cellular targets important for transformation, and understanding the molecular basis for the cell type-specific action of the viral T antigens are two important areas through which SV40 will continue to contribute to our understanding of cancer.},

abstract = {FACT is a heterodimer of SPT16 and SSRP1, which each contain several conserved regions in the primary structure. The interaction of FACT with nucleosomes induces chromatin remodeling through the combinatorial action of its distinct functional protein regions. However, there is little mechanistic insight into how these regions cooperatively contribute to FACT functions, particularly regarding the recognition of nucleosomal DNA. Here, we report the identification of novel phosphorylation sites of Drosophila melanogaster FACT (dFACT) expressed in Sf9 cells. These sites are densely concentrated in the acidic intrinsically disordered (ID) region of the SSRP1 subunit and control nucleosomal DNA binding by dFACT. This region and the adjacent segment of the HMG domain form weak electrostatic intramolecular interactions, which is reinforced by the phosphorylation, thereby blocking DNA binding competitively. Importantly, this control mechanism appears to support rapid chromatin transactions during early embryogenesis through the dephosphorylation of some sites in the maternally transmitted dSSRP1.},

abstract = {The development of new enzyme immobilization techniques that do not affect catalytic activity or conformation of a protein is an important research task in biotechnology including biosensor applications and heterogeneous reaction systems. One of the most promising approaches for controlled protein immobilization is based on the immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) principle originally developed for protein purification. Here we describe the current status and future perspectives of immobilization of His-tagged proteins on electrode surfaces. Recombinant proteins comprising histidine-tags or histidine rich native proteins have a strong affinity to transition metal ions. For metal ion immobilization at the electrode surface different matrices can be used such as self-assembled monolayers or conductive polymers. This specific technique allows a reversible immobilization of histidine-tagged proteins at electrodes in a defined orientation which is an important prerequisite for efficient electron transfer between the electrode and the biomolecule. Any application requiring immobilized biocatalysts on electrodes can make use of this immobilization approach, making future biosensors and biocatalytic technologies more sensitive, simpler, reusable and less expensive while only requiring mild enzyme modifications.},

SPs are composed of aggregated ␤-amyloid (A␤) 40/42(43) peptides. Evidence implicates a central role for A␤ in the pathophysiology of AD. Mutations in ␤APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) lead to elevated secretion of A␤, especially the more amyloidogenic A␤42. Immuno-histochemical studies have also emphasized the im-portance of A␤42 in initiating plaque pathology. Cell biological studies have demonstrated that A␤ is gen-erated intracellularly. Recently , endogenous A␤42 staining was demonstrated within cultured neurons by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and within neurons of PS1 mutant transgenic mice. A cen-tral question about the role of A␤ in disease concerns whether extracellular A␤ deposition or intracellular A␤ accumulation initiates the disease process. Here we report that human neurons in AD-vulnerable brain regions specifically accumulate ␥-cleaved A␤42 and suggest that this intraneuronal A␤42 immunore-activity appears to precede both NFT and A␤ plaque deposition. This study suggests that intracellular A␤42 accumulation is an early event in neuronal dys-function and that preventing intraneuronal A␤42 aggregation may be an important therapeutic direc-tion for the treatment of AD. (Am J Pathol 2000, 156:15–20) Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology is classically characterized by the accumulation of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in vulnerable brain regions. SPs are composed of parenchymal and cerebrovascular aggregates of ␤-amyloid (A␤) 40/42(43) peptides. Increasing evidence indicates that A␤ plays a central role in the pathophysiology of AD. Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) have an extra copy of chromo-some 21, where the gene encoding the ␤-amyloid pre-cursor protein (␤APP) is localized, and invariably develop AD pathology at an early age. Mutations in ␤APP segre-gate with some forms of autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD). Transgenic mice bearing FAD ␤APP mutations develop striking AD-like senile plaque pathology. 1 FAD mutations in ␤APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) lead to elevated secretion of A␤, especially the more amyloidogenic A␤42. In addition, immunohistochemical studies have un-derscored the importance of A␤42 as the initiator of plaque pathology in AD and DS. 2,3},

Here we report that looping is not idiosyncratic to long genes but occurs between the distal ends of genes with ORFs as short as 1 kb. Moreover, looping is dependent upon the general transcription factor TFIIB: the E62K (glutamic acid 62 --{\textgreater} lysine) form of TFIIB adversely affects looping at every gene tested, including BLM10, SAC3, GAL10, SEN1, and HEM3. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP. We propose a model suggesting that TFIIB binds RNAP II at the terminator, which in turn associates with the promoter scaffold.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by senile plaques and neurofibrillary components. A??(1-42) is a principal component of senile plaques and is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of the disease. The Alzheimer's disease brain is under significant oxidative stress, and the A??(1-42) peptide is known to cause oxidative stress in vitro. One controversy in the amyloid hypothesis is whether or not A?? plaques are required for toxicity. We have employed a temperature-inducible A?? expression system in Caenorhabditis elegans to create a strain of worms, CL4176, in which A??(1-42) is expressed with a non-permissive temperature of 23??C. The CL4176 strain allows examination of the temporal relationship between A?? expression, oxidative stress, and A?? fibril formation. CL4176 were under increased oxidative stress, evidenced by increased protein oxidation indexed by increased carbonyl levels, 24 and 32h after temperature upshift as compared to the control strain, CL1175. The increased oxidative stress in CL4176 occurred in the absence of A?? fibril formation, consistent with the notion that the toxic species in A?? toxicity is pre-fibrillar A?? and not the A?? fibril. These results are discussed with reference to Alzheimer's disease. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

The advent of proteomics has allowed for high-Throughput screening methods to search for biomarkers that could lead to early diagnosis and treatment and to identify alterations in the cellular proteome that could provide insight into disease etiology and possible treatment avenues. In this review, we have concentrated mainly on the findings that are related to how and whether proteomics studies have contributed to two aspects of AD research, the development of biomarkers for clinical diagnostics, and the recognition of proteins that can help elucidate the pathways leading to AD brain pathology. As a result of these studies, several candidate cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are now available for further validation in different AD cohorts. Studies in AD brain and AD transgenic models support the notion that oxidative damage results in the alterations of metabolic enzymes and that mitochondrial dysfunction is central to AD neuropathology.},

Understanding the molecular pathology of AD during disease progression may identify new ways to reduce neuronal damage. Here, we present a longitudinal study tracking dynamic proteomic alterations in the brains of an inducible Drosophila melanogaster model of AD expressing the Arctic mutant A$\beta$42 gene. We identified 3093 proteins from flies that were induced to express A$\beta$42 and age-matched healthy controls using label-free quantitative ion-mobility data independent analysis mass spectrometry. Of these, 228 proteins were significantly altered by A$\beta$42 accumulation and were enriched for AD-associated processes. Network analyses further revealed that these proteins have distinct hub and bottleneck properties in the brain protein interaction network, suggesting that several may have significant effects on brain function. Our unbiased analysis provides useful insights into the key processes governing the progression of amyloid toxicity and forms a basis for further functional analyses in model organisms and translation to mammalian systems.},

abstract = {Although single base-pair substitutions in splice junctions constitute at least 10{\%} of all mutations causing human inherited disease, the factors that determine their phenotypic consequences at the RNA level remain to be fully elucidated. Employing a neural network for splice-site recognition, we performed a meta-analysis of 478 disease-associated splicing mutations, in 38 different genes, for which detailed laboratory-based mRNA phenotype assessment had been performed. Inspection of the +/-50-bp DNA sequence context of the mutations revealed that exon skipping was the preferred phenotype when the immediate vicinity of the affected exon-intron junctions was devoid of alternative splice-sites. By contrast, in the presence of at least one such motif, cryptic splice-site utilization, became more prevalent. This association was, however, confined to donor splice-sites. Outside the obligate dinucleotide, the spatial distribution of pathological mutations was found to differ significantly from that of SNPs. Whereas disease-associated lesions clustered at positions -1 and +3 to +6 for donor sites and -3 for acceptor sites, SNPs were found to be almost evenly distributed over all sequence positions considered. When all putative missense mutations in the vicinity of splice-sites were extracted from the Human Gene Mutation Database for the 38 studied genes, a significantly higher proportion of changes at donor sites (37/152; 24.3{\%}) than at acceptor splice-sites (1/142; 0.7{\%}) was found to reduce the neural network signal emitted by the respective splice-site. Based upon these findings, we estimate that some 1.6{\%} of disease-causing missense substitutions in human genes are likely to affect the mRNA splicing phenotype. Taken together, our results are consistent with correct donor splice-site recognition being a key step in exon recognition.},

abstract = {The twin-arginine translocase (Tat) carries out the remarkable process of translocating fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. Tat is required for bacterial pathogenesis and for photosynthesis in plants. TatA, the protein-translocating element of the Tat system, is a small transmembrane protein that assembles into ring-like oligomers of variable size. We have determined a structural model of the Escherichia coli TatA complex in detergent solution by NMR. TatA assembly is mediated entirely by the transmembrane helix. The amphipathic helix extends outwards from the ring of transmembrane helices, permitting assembly of complexes with variable subunit numbers. Transmembrane residue Gln8 points inward, resulting in a short hydrophobic pore in the center of the complex. Simulations of the TatA complex in lipid bilayers indicate that the short transmembrane domain distorts the membrane. This finding suggests that TatA facilitates protein transport by sensitizing the membrane to transient rupture.},

@article{Pancaldi2011,
abstract = {Post-transcriptional gene regulation is mediated through complex networks of protein-RNA interactions. The targets of only a few RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are known, even in the well-characterized budding yeast. In silico prediction of protein-RNA interactions is therefore useful to guide experiments and to provide insight into regulatory networks. Computational approaches have identified RBP targets based on sequence binding preferences. We investigate here to what extent RBP-RNA interactions can be predicted based on RBP and mRNA features other than sequence motifs. We analyze global relationships between gene and protein properties in general and between selected RBPs and known mRNA targets in particular. Highly translated RBPs tend to bind to shorter transcripts, and transcripts bound by the same RBP show high expression correlation across different biological conditions. Surprisingly, a given RBP preferentially binds to mRNAs that encode interaction partners for this RBP, suggesting coordinated post-transcriptional auto-regulation of protein complexes. We apply a machine-learning approach to predict specific RBP targets in yeast. Although this approach performs well for RBPs with known targets, predictions for uncharacterized RBPs remain challenging due to limiting experimental data. We also predict targets of fission yeast RBPs, indicating that the suggested framework could be applied to other species once more experimental data are available.},

@article{Kim2011,
abstract = {A chromatin code appears to mark introns and exons with distinct patterns of nucleosome enrichment and histone methylation. We investigated whether a causal relationship exists between splicing and chromatin modification by asking whether splice-site mutations affect the methylation of histone H3K36. Deletions of the 3' splice site in intron 2 or in both introns 1 and 2 of an integrated $\beta$-globin reporter gene caused a shift in relative distribution of H3K36 trimethylation away from 5' ends and toward 3' ends. The effects of splice-site mutations correlated with enhanced retention of a U5 snRNP subunit on transcription complexes downstream of the gene. In contrast, a poly(A) site mutation did not affect H3K36 methylation. Similarly, global inhibition of splicing by spliceostatin A caused a rapid repositioning of H3K36me3 away from 5' ends in favor of 3' ends. These results suggest that the cotranscriptional splicing apparatus influences establishment of normal patterns of histone modification.},

As the droplets grow smaller the increase in surface charge density and the decrease in radius of curvature result in electric fields strong enough to desorb solute ions. Part of the resulting dispersion of ions in bath gas passes through a small orifice or channel into an evacuated region to form a supersonic free jet. The core of this jet passes through a conical skimmer orifice and transports the ions to the inlet of a mass analyzer.

It has been proposed that telomere shortening is the molecular clock that triggers senescence. To test this hypothesis, two telomerase-negative normal human cell types, retinal pigment epithelial cells and foreskin fibroblasts, were transfected with vectors encoding the human telomerase catalytic subunit. In contrast to telomerase-negative control clones, which exhibited telomere shortening and senescence, telomerase-expressing clones had elongated telomeres, divided vigorously, and showed reduced straining for beta-galactosidase, a biomarker for senescence. Notably, the telomerase-expressing clones have a normal karyotype and have already exceeded their normal life-span by at least 20 doublings, thus establishing a causal relationship between telomere shortening and in vitro cellular senescence. The ability to maintain normal human cells in a phenotypically youthful state could have important applications in research and medicine.},

This focus has driven the necessary methodological developments to enable the recovery of prokaryotic genomes from metagenomes, which has reliably yielded genomes from thousands of novel species. More recently, microbial eukaryotes have gained more attention, but there is yet to be a parallel explosion in the number of eukaryotic genomes recovered from metagenomic samples. One of the current deficiencies is the lack of a universally applicable and reliable tool for the estimation of eukaryote genome quality. To address this need, we have developed EukCC, a tool for estimating the quality of eukaryotic genomes based on the dynamic selection of single copy marker gene sets, with the aim of applying it to metagenomics datasets. We demonstrate that our method outperforms current genome quality estimators and have applied EukCC to datasets from two different biomes to enable the identification of novel genomes, including a eukaryote found on the human skin and a Bathycoccus species obtained from a marine sample.},

However, the biochemical properties of p53 and the effect of mutation on these properties are unclear. A human DNA sequence was identified that binds specifically to wild-type human p53 protein in vitro. As few as 33 base pairs were sufficient to confer specific binding. Certain guanines within this 33-base pair region were critical, as methylation of these guanines or their substitution with thymine-abrogated binding. Human p53 proteins containing either of two missense mutations commonly found in human tumors were unable to bind significantly to this sequence. These data suggest that a function of p53 may be mediated by its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences in the human genome, and that this activity is altered by mutations that occur in human tumors.},

Here we report ionic current detection of all twenty proteinogenic amino acids in an aerolysin nanopore with the help of a short polycationic carrier. Application of molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the aerolysin nanopore has a built-in single-molecule trap that fully confines a polycationic carrier-bound amino acid inside the sensing region of the aerolysin. This structural feature means that each amino acid spends sufficient time in the pore for sensitive measurement of the excluded volume of the amino acid. We show that distinct current blockades in wild-type aerolysin can be used to identify 13 of the 20 natural amino acids. Furthermore, we show that chemical modifications, instrumentation advances and nanopore engineering offer a route toward identification of the remaining seven amino acids. These findings may pave the way to nanopore protein sequencing.},

abstract = {C1q is the first subcomponent of the C1 complex of the classical pathway of complement activation. Several functions have been assigned to C1q, which include antibody-dependent and independent immune functions, and are considered to be mediated by C1q receptors present on the effector cell surface. There remains some uncertainty about the identities of the receptors that mediate C1q functions. Some of the previously described C1q receptor molecules, such as gC1qR and cC1qR, now appear to have less of a role in C1q functions than in functions unrelated to C1q. The problem of identifying receptor proteins with complementary binding sites for C1q has been compounded by the highly charged nature of the different domains in C1q. Although newer candidate receptors like C1qR(p) and CR1 have emerged, full analysis of the C1q-C1q receptor interactions is still at an early stage. In view of the diverse functions that C1q is considered to perform, it has been speculated that several C1q-binding proteins may act in concert, as a C1q receptor complex, to bring about C1q mediated functions. Some major advances have been made in last few years. Experiments with gene targeted homozygous C1q-deficient mice have suggested a role for C1q in modulation of the humoral immune response, and also in protection against development of autoimmunity. The recently described crystal structure of Acrp-30, which is a serum protein secreted from adipocytes, has revealed a new C1q/TNF superfamily of proteins. Although the members of this superfamily may have diverse functions, there may be a common theme in their phylogeny and modular organisation of their distinctive globular domains.},

abstract = {The complement (C) inflammatory cascade is part of the phylogenetically ancient innate immune response and is crucial to our natural ability to ward off infection. It has three critical physiologic activities: (i) defending against microbial infections by triggering the generation of a membranolytic complex (C5b9 complex) at the surface of the pathogen and C fragments (named opsonins, i.e., C1q, C3b and iC3b) which interact with C cell surface receptors (CR1, CR3 and CR4) to promote phagocytosis. Soluble C anaphylatoxins (C4a, C3a and C5a) greatly control the local pro-inflammatory response through the chemotaxis and activation of leukocytes; (ii) bridging innate and adaptive immunity (essentially through C receptor type 2, CR2, expressed by B cells) and (iii) disposing of immune complexes and the products of the inflammatory injury (i.e., other danger signals, e.g., toxic cell debris and apoptotic corpses) to ensure the protection and healing of the host. The regulatory mechanisms of C are finely balanced so that, on the one hand, the deposition of C is focused on the surface of invading microorganisms and, on the other hand, the deposition of C on normal cells is limited by several key C inhibitors (e.g., CD46, CD55 and CD59). Knowledge of the unique molecular and cellular innate immunological interactions that occur in the development and resolution of pathology should facilitate the design of effective therapeutic strategies to fight selectively against intruders. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Evolution and medicine share a dependence on the genotype-phenotype map. Although genotypes exist and are inherited in a discrete space convenient for many sorts of analyses, the causation of key phenomena such as natural selection and disease takes place in a continuous phenotype space whose relationship to the genotype space is only dimly grasped. Direct study of genotypes with minimal reference to phenotypes is clearly insufficient to elucidate these phenomena. Phenomics, the comprehensive study of phenotypes, is therefore essential to understanding biology. For all of the advances in knowledge that a genomic approach to biology has brought, awareness is growing that many phenotypes are highly polygenic and susceptible to genetic interactions. Prime examples are common human diseases. Phenomic thinking is starting to take hold and yield results that reveal why it is so critical. The dimensionality of phenotypic data are often extremely high, suggesting that attempts to characterize phenotypes with a few key measurements are unlikely to be completely successful. However, once phenotypic data are obtained, causation can turn out to be unexpectedly simple. Phenotypic data can be informative about the past history of selection and unexpectedly predictive of long-term evolution. Comprehensive efforts to increase the throughput and range of phenotyping are an urgent priority.},

abstract = {Comparison of the primary structures of high-Mr urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator reveals a high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, except that tissue activator contains a 43 residue long amino-terminal region, which has no counterpart in urokinase. We show that this segment is homologous with the finger-domains responsible for the fibrin-affinity of fibronectin. Limited proteolysis of the amino-terminal region of plasminogen activator was found to lead to a loss of the fibrin-affinity of the enzyme. It is suggested that the finger-domains of fibronectin and tissue-types plasminogen activator have similar functions and that the finger-domains of the two proteins evolved from a common ancestral fibrin-binding domain.},

abstract = {Synaptic impairment rather than neuronal loss may be the leading cause of cognitive dysfunction in brain aging. Certain small Rho-GTPases are involved in synaptic plasticity, and their dysfunction is associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration. Rho-GTPases undergo prenylation by attachment of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) catalyzed by GGTase-I. We examined age-related changes in the abundance of Rho and Rab proteins in membrane and cytosolic fractions as well as of GGTase-I in brain tissue of 3- and 23-month-old C57BL/6 mice. We report a shift in the cellular localization of Rho-GTPases toward reduced levels of membrane-associated and enhanced cytosolic levels of those proteins in aged mouse brain as compared with younger mice. The age-related reduction in membrane-associated Rho proteins was associated with a reduction in GGTase-I$\beta$ levels that regulates binding of GGPP to Rho-GTPases. Proteins prenylated by GGTase-II were not reduced in aged brain indicating a specific targeting of GGTase-I in the aged brain. Inhibition of GGTase-I in vitro modeled the effects of aging we observed in vivo. We demonstrate for the first time a decrease in membrane-associated Rho proteins in aged brain in association with down-regulation of GGTase-I$\beta$. This down-regulation could be one of the mechanisms causing age-related weakening of synaptic plasticity. Rho-GTPases are geranylgeranylated by transferase GGTase-I. Their prenylation is essential for their localization in membranes, the site of their activation and function. Despite elevated GGPP levels in brains of aged (23 months) mice compared to younger (3 months) mice as well as in GGTI-2133-treated SH-SY5Y cells, the amount of total (homogenate) Rho-GTPases (Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42) was unchanged. Treatment with the GGTaseI-inhibitor GGTI-2133 decreased prenylation of Rho-GTPases in membrane preparations of aged mice and SH-SY5Y, correlating with the reduction of relative GGTase activity, GGTaseI{\ss} protein, and mRNA levels. As Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 are associated with synaptogenesis, we examined the synaptic marker proteins GAP43 and synaptophysin. GAP43 and synaptophysin declined in an age-related manner in the mouse brain and were also reduced in our in vitro model. Faulty regulation of Rho proteins in aged brain is associated with a specific deficit in GGTase-I$\beta$, which could contribute to age-related deficits in neuronal outgrowth.

abstract = {Genetic factors underlying aging are remarkably conserved from yeast to human. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an emerging genetic model to analyze cellular aging. Chronological lifespan (CLS) has been studied in stationary-phase yeast cells depleted for glucose, which only survive for a few days. Here, we analyzed CLS in quiescent S. pombe cells deprived of nitrogen, which arrest in a differentiated, G0-like state and survive for more than 2 months. We applied parallel mutant phenotyping by barcode sequencing (Bar-seq) to assay pooled haploid deletionmutants as they aged together during long- term quiescence. As expected, mutants with defects in autophagy or quiescence were under-represented or not detected. Lifespan scores could be calculated for 1199 mutants. We focus the discussion on the 48 most long-lived mutants, including both known aging genes in other model systems and genes not previously implicated in aging. Genes encoding membrane proteins were particularly prominent as pro-aging factors. We independently verified the extended CLS in individual assays for 30 selected mutants, showing the efficacy of the screen. We also applied Bar-seq to profile all pooled deletion mutants for proliferation under a standard growth condition. Unlike for stationary-phase cells, no inverse correlation between growth and CLS of quiescent cells was evident. These screens provide a rich resource for further studies, and they suggest that the quiescence model can provide unique, complementary insights into cellular aging.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most tumor samples are a heterogeneous mixture of cells, including admixture by normal (non-cancerous) cells and subpopulations of cancerous cells with different complements of somatic aberrations. This intra-tumor heterogeneity complicates the analysis of somatic aberrations in DNA sequencing data from tumor samples.

RESULTS: We describe an algorithm called THetA2 that infers the composition of a tumor sample-including not only tumor purity but also the number and content of tumor subpopulations-directly from both whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome (WXS) high-throughput DNA sequencing data. This algorithm builds on our earlier Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis (THetA) algorithm in several important directions. These include improved ability to analyze highly rearranged genomes using a variety of data types: both WGS sequencing (including low ∼7× coverage) and WXS sequencing. We apply our improved THetA2 algorithm to WGS (including low-pass) and WXS sequence data from 18 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find that the improved algorithm is substantially faster and identifies numerous tumor samples containing subclonal populations in the TCGA data, including in one highly rearranged sample for which other tumor purity estimation algorithms were unable to estimate tumor purity.

We present a method based on the assumption that proteins that function together in a pathway or structural complex are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion.

We describe this property of correlated evolution by characterizing each protein by its phylogenetic profile, a string that encodes the presence or absence of a protein in every known genome. We show that proteins having matching or similar profiles strongly tend to be functionally linked. This method of phylogenetic profiling allows us to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins.},

abstract = {Background: Metatranscriptomic sequencing is a highly sensitive bioassay of functional activity in a microbial community, providing complementary information to the metagenomic sequencing of the community. The acquisition of the metatranscriptomic sequences will enable us to refine the annotations of the metagenomes, and to study the gene activities and their regulation in complex microbial communities and their dynamics. Results: In this paper, we present TransGeneScan, a software tool for finding genes in assembled transcripts from metatranscriptomic sequences. By incorporating several features of metatranscriptomic sequencing, including strand-specificity, short intergenic regions, and putative antisense transcripts into a Hidden Markov Model, TranGeneScan can predict a sense transcript containing one or multiple genes (in an operon) or an antisense transcript. Conclusion: We tested TransGeneScan on a mock metatranscriptomic data set containing three known bacterial genomes. The results showed that TranGeneScan performs better than metagenomic gene finders (MetaGeneMark and FragGeneScan) on predicting protein coding genes in assembled transcripts, and achieves comparable or even higher accuracy than gene finders for microbial genomes (Glimmer and GeneMark). These results imply, with the assistance of metatranscriptomic sequencing, we can obtain a broad and precise picture about the genes (and their functions) in a microbial community.

abstract = {Water channels facilitate the rapid transport of water across cell membranes in response to osmotic gradients. These channels are believed to be involved in many physiological processes that include renal water conservation, neuro-homeostasis, digestion, regulation of body temperature and reproduction. Members of the water channel superfamily have been found in a range of cell types from bacteria to human. In mammals, there are currently 10 families of water channels, referred to as aquaporins (AQP): AQP0-AQP9. Here we report the structure of the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel to 2.2 A resolution. The channel consists of three topological elements, an extracellular and a cytoplasmic vestibule connected by an extended narrow pore or selectivity filter. Within the selectivity filter, four bound waters are localized along three hydrophilic nodes, which punctuate an otherwise extremely hydrophobic pore segment. This unusual combination of a long hydrophobic pore and a minimal number of solute binding sites facilitates rapid water transport. Residues of the constriction region, in particular histidine 182, which is conserved among all known water-specific channels, are critical in establishing water specificity. Our analysis of the AQP1 pore also indicates that the transport of protons through this channel is highly energetically unfavourable.},

Given the plethora of genetic studies, sequenced exomes, and new protein structures determined each year, it is appropriate to revisit the role that structure plays in providing insights into the molecular basis of disease-associated mutations. In that regard, a large-scale structural analysis of 6,025 disease-associated mutations as well as 4,536 neutral variations for comparison was performed. While buried amino acids are common among the disease-associated mutations, as reported previously, more are statistically significantly enriched at observed or predicted functional sites. Interesting findings are that ligand-binding sites adjacent to protein-protein interfaces and residues involved in enzymatic function are especially vulnerable to disease-associated mutations. Finally, a compositional analysis of disease-associated mutations in comparison with variants identified in the 1000 Genomes Project provides a structural rationalization of the most disease-associated residue types.},

The rod adopts a helical quaternary structure and is thought to play essential roles: its formation may drive pilus extrusion by preventing backsliding of the nascent growing pilus within the secretion pore; the rod also has striking spring-like properties, being able to uncoil and recoil depending on the intensity of shear forces generated by urine flow. Here, we present an atomic model of the P pilus generated from a 3.8 {\AA} resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. This structure provides the molecular basis for the rod's remarkable mechanical properties and illuminates its role in pilus secretion.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. When the food intake of organisms such as yeast and rodents is reduced (dietary restriction), they live longer than organisms fed a normal diet. A similar effect is seen when the activity of nutrient-sensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span and protects against diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in rhesus monkeys, and in humans it causes changes that protect against these age-related pathologies. Tumors and diabetes are also uncommon in humans with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, and natural genetic variants in nutrient-sensing pathways are associated with increased human life span. Dietary restriction and reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways may thus slow aging by similar mechanisms, which have been conserved during evolution. We discuss these findings and their potential application to prevention of age-related disease and promotion of healthy aging in humans, and the challenge of possible negative side effects.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels open and close, or "gate," in response to changes in membrane potential. The electric field across the membrane-protein complex exerts forces on charged residues driving the channel into different functional conformations as the membrane potential changes. To act with the greatest sensitivity, charged residues must be positioned at key locations within or near the transmembrane region, which requires desolvating charged groups, a process that can be energetically prohibitive. Although there is good agreement on which residues are involved in this process for voltage-activated potassium channels, several different models of the sensor geometry and gating motions have been proposed. Here we incorporate low-resolution structural information about the channel into a Poisson-Boltzmann calculation to determine solvation barrier energies and gating charge values associated with each model. The principal voltage-sensing helix, S4, is represented explicitly, whereas all other regions are represented as featureless, dielectric media with complex boundaries. From our calculations, we conclude that a pure rotation of the S4 segment within the voltage sensor is incapable of producing the observed gating charge values, although this shortcoming can be partially remedied by first tipping and then minimally translating the S4 helix. Models in which the S4 segment has substantial interaction with the low-dielectric environment of the membrane incur solvation energies of hundreds of k(B)T, and activation times based on these energies are orders of magnitude slower than experimentally observed.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive, age-dependent degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system. A large body of evidence indicates that neurons affected in AD follow a dying-back pattern of degeneration, where abnormalities in synaptic function and axonal connectivity long precede somatic cell death. Mechanisms underlying dying-back degeneration of neurons in AD remain elusive but several have been proposed, including deficits in fast axonal transport (FAT). Accordingly, genetic evidence linked alterations in FAT to dying-back degeneration of neurons, and FAT defects have been widely documented in various AD models. In light of these findings, we discuss experimental evidence linking several AD-related pathogenic polypeptides to aberrant activation of signaling pathways involved in the phosphoregulation of microtubule-based motor proteins. While each pathway appears to affect FAT in a unique manner, in the context of AD, many of these pathways might work synergistically to compromise the delivery of molecular components critical for the maintenance and function of synapses and axons. Therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing FAT deficits by normalizing the activity of specific protein kinases may help prevent degeneration of vulnerable neurons in AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Sodium/proton (Na(+)/H(+)) antiporters, located at the plasma membrane in every cell, are vital for cell homeostasis. In humans, their dysfunction has been linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they are well-established drug targets. The best understood model system for Na(+)/H(+) antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli, for which both electron microscopy and crystal structures are available. NhaA is made up of two distinct domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding site from the inward-facing surface of the protein. Like many Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above pH 6.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur. The only reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form. Here we describe the active-state structure of a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus, at 3 {\AA} resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH 7.8. In the NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding directly, a role supported here by molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20° against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport rates of up to 1,500 ions per second, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active transporters in general.},

abstract = {Colicin B is a 55 kDa dumbbell-shaped protein toxin that uses the TonB system (outer membrane transporter, FepA, and three cytoplasmic membrane proteins TonB/ExbB/ExbD) to enter and kill Escherichia coli. FepA is a 22-stranded beta-barrel with its lumen filled by an amino-terminal globular domain containing an N-terminal semiconserved region, known as the TonB box, to which TonB binds. To investigate the mechanism of colicin B translocation across the outer membrane, we engineered cysteine (Cys) substitutions in the globular domain of FepA. Colicin B caused increased exposure to biotin maleimide labelling of all Cys substitutions, but to different degrees, with TonB as well as the FepA TonB box required for all increases. Because of the large increases in exposure for Cys residues from T13 to T51, we conclude that colicin B is translocated through the lumen of FepA, rather than along the lipid-barrel interface or through another protein. Part of the FepA globular domain (residues V91-V142) proved relatively refractory to labelling, indicating either that the relevant Cys residues were sequestered by an unknown protein or that a significant portion of the FepA globular domain remained inside the barrel, requiring concomitant conformational rearrangement of colicin B during its translocation. Unexpectedly, TonB was also required for colicin-induced exposure of the FepA TonB box, suggesting that TonB binds FepA at a different site prior to interaction with the TonB box.},

abstract = {Gene networks are commonly interpreted as encoding functional information in their connections. An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share function. Guilt by association provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the network. In effect, the apparent encoding of function within networks has been largely driven by outliers whose behaviour cannot even be generalized to individual genes, let alone to the network at large. While experimentalist-driven analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale computational analyses have typically assumed that high-performance cross-validation in a network is due to a generalizable encoding of function. Because we find that gene function is not systemically encoded in networks, but dependent on specific and critical interactions, we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks encode function and what information computational analyses use to extract functional meaning. We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as scale-free-like behaviour, do not map onto the functional connectivity within networks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present peptide-pair encoding (PPE), a general-purpose probabilistic segmentation of protein sequences into commonly occurring variable-length sub-sequences. The idea of PPE segmentation is inspired by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) text compression algorithm, which has recently gained popularity in subword neural machine translation. We modify this algorithm by adding a sampling framework allowing for multiple ways of segmenting a sequence. PPE segmentation steps can be learned over a large set of protein sequences (Swiss-Prot) or even a domain-specific dataset and then applied to a set of unseen sequences. This representation can be widely used as the input to any downstream machine learning tasks in protein bioinformatics. In particular, here, we introduce this representation through protein motif discovery and protein sequence embedding. (i) DiMotif: we present DiMotif as an alignment-free discriminative motif discovery method and evaluate the method for finding protein motifs in three different settings: (1) comparison of DiMotif with two existing approaches on 20 distinct motif discovery problems which are experimentally verified, (2) classification-based approach for the motifs extracted for integrins, integrin-binding proteins, and biofilm formation, and (3) in sequence pattern searching for nuclear localization signal. The DiMotif, in general, obtained high recall scores, while having a comparable F1 score with other methods in the discovery of experimentally verified motifs. Having high recall suggests that the DiMotif can be used for short-list creation for further experimental investigations on motifs. In the classification-based evaluation, the extracted motifs could reliably detect the integrins, integrin-binding, and biofilm formation-related proteins on a reserved set of sequences with high F1 scores. (ii) ProtVecX: we extend k-mer based protein vector (ProtVec) embedding to variablelength protein embedding using PPE sub-sequences. We show that the new method of embedding can marginally outperform ProtVec in enzyme prediction as well as toxin prediction tasks. In addition, we conclude that the embeddings are beneficial in protein classification tasks when they are combined with raw amino acids k-mer features.},

abstract = {Microbial colony growth can serve as a useful readout in assays for studying complex genetic interactions or the effects of chemical compounds. Although computational tools for acquiring quantitative measurements of microbial colonies have been developed, their utility can be compromised by inflexible input image requirements, non-trivial installation procedures, or complicated operation. Here, we present the Spotsizer software tool for automated colony size measurements in images of robotically arrayed microbial colonies. Spotsizer features a convenient graphical user interface (GUI), has both single-image and batch-processing capabilities, and works with multiple input image formats and different colony grid types. We demonstrate how Spotsizer can be used for high-throughput quantitative analysis of fission yeast growth. The user-friendly Spotsizer tool provides rapid, accurate, and robust quantitative analyses of microbial growth in a high-throughput format. Spotsizer is freely available at https://data.csiro.au/dap/landingpage?pid=csiro:15330 under a proprietary CSIRO license.},

abstract = {Here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative, gamma-Proteobacterium Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961 to be 4,033,460 base pairs (bp). The genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,961,146 bp and 1,072,314 bp that together encode 3,885 open reading frames. The vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions (such as DNA replication, transcription, translation and cell-wall biosynthesis) and pathogenicity (for example, toxins, surface antigens and adhesins) are located on the large chromosome. In contrast, the small chromosome contains a larger fraction (59{\%}) of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome (42{\%}), and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-Proteobacteria. The small chromosome also carries a gene capture system (the integron island) and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids; thus, the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral Vibrio species. The V. cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living, environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen.},

abstract = {Although discovered long ago, posttranslational phosphorylation of histones has been in the spotlight only recently. Information is accumulating almost daily on phosphorylation of histones and their roles in cellular physiology and human diseases. An extensive cross talk exists between phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications, which together regulate various biological processes, including gene transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. Recent research on histone phosphorylation has demonstrated that nearly all histone types are phosphorylated at specific residues and that these modifications act as a critical intermediate step in chromosome condensation during cell division, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. As with all young fields, apparently conflicting and sometimes controversial observations about histone phosphorylations and their true functions in different species are found in the literature. Accumulating evidence suggests that instead of functioning strictly as part of a general code, histone phosphorylation probably functions by establishing cross talk with other histone modifications and serving as a platform for recruitment or release of effector proteins, leading to a downstream cascade of events. Here we extensively review published information on the complexities of histone phosphorylation, the roles of proteins recognizing these modifications and the resuting physiological outcome, and, importantly, future challenges and opportunities in this fast-moving field.},

We have investigated the possibility that $\beta$-amyloid itself disrupts mitochondrial function. Isolated rat brain mitochondria have been incubated with the $\beta$-amyloid alone or together with nitric oxide, which is known to be elevated in Alzheimer's brain. Mitochondrial respiration, electron transport chain complex activities, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity have been measured. $\beta$-Amyloid caused a significant reduction in state 3 and state 4 mitochondrial respiration that was further diminished by the addition of nitric oxide. Cytochrome oxidase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities were inhibited by $\beta$-amyloid. The Km of cytochrome oxidase for reduced cytochrome c was raised by $\beta$-amyloid. We conclude that $\beta$-amyloid can directly disrupt mitochondrial function, inhibits key enzymes and may contribute to the deficiency of energy metabolism seen in Alzheimer's disease.},

We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98 {\%} of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 {\%}, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 {\%} of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

We present a framework for comparing and classifying networks without human-crafted features using deep learning. After training, autoencoders contain hidden units that encode a robust structural vocabulary for succinctly describing graphs. We use this feature vocabulary to tackle several network mining problems and find improved predictive performance versus many popular features used today. These problems include uncovering growth mechanisms driving the evolution of networks, predicting protein network fragility, and identifying environmental niches for metabolic networks. Deep learning offers a principled approach for mining complex networks and tackling graph-theoretic problems.},

Upon cell cycle arrest, the ARE in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) mRNA is transformed into a translation activation signal, recruiting Argonaute (AGO) and fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1 (FXR1), factors associated with micro-ribonucleoproteins (microRNPs). We show that human microRNA miR369-3 directs association of these proteins with the AREs to activate translation. Furthermore, we document that two well-studied microRNAs-Let-7 and the synthetic microRNA miRcxcr4-likewise induce translation up-regulation of target mRNAs on cell cycle arrest, yet they repress translation in proliferating cells. Thus, activation is a common function of microRNPs on cell cycle arrest. We propose that translation regulation by microRNPs oscillates between repression and activation during the cell cycle.},

Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the links between survival of Escherichia coli in sea water microcosms in the laboratory and the presence of porins in the outer membrane. The E. coli strains studied were a wild-type strain and a series of outer membrane protein (omp) mutants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria were suspended in natural or filtered-autoclaved sea water microcosms and numbers determined over an incubation period by plate count and by count of cells capable of respiration. CONCLUSIONS: The type of omp mutation has a significant impact in bacterial survival. The double OmpC-OmpF mutant and the OmpR mutant (which was incapable of synthesizing OmpC and OmpF) survived poorly compared with single omp mutants and the wild-type strain. This suggests that these proteins are important in determining the entry of E. coli into the survival mode. The EnvZ mutant, which lacks the protein by which the cell senses some changes in the environment, survived as well as the wild-type strain when compared by plate counts and by respiring cell count. The loss of the EnvZ protein has no effect on survival but it could prevent the organism sensing the changes in the environment through which entry into the survival state is triggered. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work is another piece in the puzzle as to how bacteria survive stress conditions.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Motivation: Recognizing proteins that have similar tertiary structure is the key step of template-based protein structure prediction methods. Traditionally, a variety of alignment methods are used to identify similar folds, based on sequence similarity and sequence-structure compatibility. Although these methods are complementary, their integration has not been thoroughly exploited. Statistical machine learning methods provide tools for integrating multiple features, but so far these methods have been used primarily for protein and fold classification, rather than addressing the retrieval problem of fold recognition-finding a proper template for a given query protein. Results: Here we present a two-stage machine learning, information retrieval, approach to fold recognition. First, we use alignment methods to derive pairwise similarity features for query-template protein pairs. We also use global profile-profile alignments in combination with predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact map and beta-strand pairing to extract pairwise structural compatibility features. Second, we apply support vector machines to these features to predict the structural relevance (i.e. in the same fold or not) of the query-template pairs. For each query, the continuous relevance scores are used to rank the templates. The FOLDpro approach is modular, scalable and effective. Compared with 11 other fold recognition methods, FOLDpro yields the best results in almost all standard categories on a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Using predictions of the top-ranked template, the sensitivity is ∼85, 56, and 27{\%} at the family, superfamily and fold levels respectively. Using the 5 top-ranked templates, the sensitivity increases to 90, 70, and 48{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

Crystal structures of ASIC1a-psalmotoxin complexes map the toxin binding site to the extracellular domain and show how toxin binding triggers an expansion of the extracellular vestibule and stabilization of the open channel pore. At pH 7.25 the pore is approximately 10 {\AA} in diameter, whereas at pH 5.5 the pore is largely hydrophobic and elliptical in cross-section with dimensions of approximately 5 by 7 {\AA}, consistent with a barrier mechanism for ion selectivity.

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized pathologically by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques (SPs), and loss of synapses. The main component of SP is amyloid-beta peptide (A$\beta$), a 39 to 43 amino acid peptide, generated by the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of beta- and gamma-secretases. The presenilins (PS) are components of the $\gamma$-secretase, which contains the protease active center. Mutations in PS enhance the production of the A$\beta$42 peptide. To date, more than 160 mutations in PS1 have been identified. Many PS mutations increase the production of the $\beta$-secretase-mediated C-terminal (CT) 99 amino acid-long fragment (CT99), which is subsequently cleaved by $\gamma$-secretase to yield A$\beta$ peptides. A$\beta$ has been proposed to induce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Previous studies from our laboratory and others showed an age-dependent increase in oxidative stress markers, loss of lipid asymmetry, and A$\beta$ production and amyloid deposition in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. In the present study, we used APP NLh/APP NLh×PS-1 P246L/PS-1 P246L human double mutant knock-in APP/PS-1 mice to identify specific targets of brain protein carbonylation in an age-dependent manner. We found a number of proteins that are oxidatively modified in APP/PS1 mice compared to age-matched controls. The relevance of the identified proteins to the progression and pathogenesis of AD is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli strains carrying the cmi locus on plasmids are immune against colicin M, which primarily inhibits murein biosynthesis, followed by lysis of cells. The nucleotide sequence of the cmi region was determined. It contains an open reading frame for a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 19,227. However, the major protein band observed on polyacrylamide gels after transcription and translation in an in vitro system or in minicells had an apparent molecular weight between 15,000 and 16,000. The nucleotide sequence contained internal ATG codons, two of which could serve for the synthesis of polypeptides with molecular weights of 15,349 and 15,996, respectively. A subclone with a DNA fragment that encoded these two shorter polypeptides exhibited full immunity. The colicin M immunity protein was found in the cytoplasmic membrane. The colicin M activity and immunity genes were transcribed in opposite directions. Both properties are typical of the channel-forming colicins and are in contrast to the colicins with endonuclease activities. However, colicin M does not form channels and exhibits no structural similarity to channel-forming colicins.

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells adhere to endothelial cells, thereby obstructing the microvasculature. Erythrocyte adherence is directly associated with severe malaria and increased disease lethality, and it is mediated by the PfEMP1 family. PfEMP1 clustering in knob-like protrusions on the erythrocyte membrane is critical for cytoadherence, however the molecular mechanisms behind this system remain elusive. Here, we show that the intracellular domains of the PfEMP1 family (ATS) share a unique molecular architecture, which comprises a minimal folded core and extensive flexible elements. A conserved flexible segment at the ATS center is minimally restrained by the folded core. Yeast-two-hybrid data and a novel sequence analysis method suggest that this central segment contains a conserved protein interaction epitope. Interestingly, ATS in solution fails to bind the parasite knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP), an essential cytoadherence component. Instead, we demonstrate that ATS associates with PFI1780w, a member of the Plasmodium helical interspersed sub-telomeric (PHIST) family. PHIST domains are widespread in exported parasite proteins, however this is the first specific molecular function assigned to any variant of this family. We propose that PHIST domains facilitate protein interactions, and that the conserved ATS epitope may be targeted to disrupt the parasite cytoadherence system.},

abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recentlyshown impressive results across avarietyof domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood.Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-And discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Lifelong persistence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in infected hosts is mainly owed to the virus' pronounced abilities to evade immune responses of its human host. Active immune evasion mechanisms reduce the immunogenicity of infected cells and are known to be of major importance during lytic infection. The EBV genes BCRF1 and BNLF2a encode the viral homologue of IL-10 (vIL-10) and an inhibitor of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), respectively. Both are known immunoevasins in EBV's lytic phase. Here we describe that BCRF1 and BNLF2a are functionally expressed instantly upon infection of primary B cells. Using EBV mutants deficient in BCRF1 and BNLF2a, we show that both factors contribute to evading EBV-specific immune responses during the earliest phase of infection. vIL-10 impairs NK cell mediated killing of infected B cells, interferes with CD4+ T-cell activity, and modulates cytokine responses, while BNLF2a reduces antigen presentation and recognition of newly infected cells by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Together, both factors significantly diminish the immunogenicity of EBV-infected cells during the initial, pre-latent phase of infection and may improve the establishment of a latent EBV infection in vivo.},

abstract = {Aqueous salt solutions containing NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, CaCl2, NH4Cl, or sodium saccharin are mutagenic in yeast when logarithmic growth of cells is interrupted by exposure to a 0.5-2.0 M salt solution. Stationary-phase cells are not mutated by this treatment. When placed in an enriched medium with the salt, the stationary-phase cells grow after a prolonged lag period. The compounds tested (NaCl, KCl, and sodium saccharin), under conditions in which growth in medium can take place, exhibit an antimutagenic response as measured by the compartmentalization test. The antimutagenic action of salt solutions in yeast is concentration-dependent. Unlike the mutagenic action of these compounds, which approximates an osmolality-dependent response, the antimutagenic action seems to be correlated with toxicity as measured by growth rate reduction at increasing concentrations of the compounds. For example, sodium saccharin and NaCl exhibit almost identical osmolalities; however, 0.3 M sodium saccharin reduces the growth rate much more than does 0.3 M NaCl. At these same molar concentrations, the spontaneous mutation rate for histidine prototrophy is, for the control, 6.2 x 10(-8) mutations/cell/-generation, 3.5 x 10(-8) with 0.3 M NaCl, and 1.7 x 10(-8) with 0.3 M sodium saccharin.},

However, non-biodegradability, once thought to be an advantage offered by plastics, is causing major environmental problem. Recently, a PET-degrading bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis, was identified and suggested for possible use in degradation and/or recycling of PET. However, the molecular mechanism of PET degradation is not known. Here we report the crystal structure of I. sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) at 1.5 {\AA} resolution. IsPETase has a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad at its active site and contains an optimal substrate binding site to accommodate four monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) moieties of PET. Based on structural and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, the detailed process of PET degradation into MHET, terephthalic acid, and ethylene glycol is suggested. Moreover, other PETase candidates potentially having high PET-degrading activities are suggested based on phylogenetic tree analysis of 69 PETase-like proteins.},

Here we integrate expression profiling data that have been collected by our laboratory since 2001 and that interrogate more than 900 different experimental conditions. We take advantage of this large data set to rank all genes based on their variability in gene expression across the different conditions. The most variable genes were enriched for functions such as stress response, carbohydrate metabolism and trans-membrane transport, and these genes were underrepresented for introns and tended to be close to telomeres. We then compared how overall gene regulation and variability of gene expression across conditions is affected by environmental or genetic perturbations, and by endogenous programmes. Meiotic differentiation and environmental perturbations led to substantially greater gene expression variability and overall regulation than did genetic perturbations and the transcriptional programme accompanying cell proliferation. We also used the integrated data to identify gene regulation modules using two different clustering approaches. Two major clusters, containing growth- and metabolism-related genes on one hand and stress- and differentiation-related genes on the other, were reciprocally regulated across conditions. We discuss these findings with respect to other recent reports on the regulation and evolution of gene expression.},

Although the various virulence strategies used by viral and bacterial pathogens are numerous, there are several general mechanisms that are used to subvert and exploit immune systems that are shared between these diverse microbial pathogens. The success of each pathogen is directly dependant on its ability to mount an effective anti-immune response within the infected host, which can ultimately result in acute disease, chronic infection, or pathogen clearance.

We identify problem families using protein regions that match two or more Pfam families not currently annotated as related in Pfam. We find that HMMER3 E-value estimates seem to be less accurate for families that feature periodic patterns of compositional bias, such as the ones typically observed in coiled-coils. These results support the continued use of manually curated inclusion thresholds in the Pfam database, especially on the subset of families that have been identified as problematic in experiments such as these. They also highlight the need for developing new methods that can correct for this particular type of compositional bias.},

abstract = {X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities, owing to mutations in a gene on the X chromosome. The latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic', or 'specific', mental retardation (MRXS) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific' mental retardation (MRX)1. For 9 of the 66 MRX entries, the causative gene has been identified1. Our recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR (previously known as Alport syndrome, mental retardation, midface hypoplasia, elliptocytosis, OMIM {\#}300194), characterized by Alport syndrome (ATS) and mental retardation (MR), indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one mental retardation gene2, 3. Comparing the extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone allowed us to define a critical region for mental retardation of approximately 380 kb, containing four genes4-6. Here we report the identification of two point mutations, one missense and one splice-site change, in the gene FACL4 in two families with nonspecific mental retardation. Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared with normal cells, indicating that both mutations are null mutations. All carrier females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a completely skewed X-inactivation, suggesting that the gene influences survival advantage. FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific mental retardation and fatty-acid metabolism.},

abstract = {Accumulation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) in the form of tangles of paired helical filaments and/or straight filaments is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. P-tau is also found unpolymerized in AD. Although the cognitive decline is known to correlate with the degree of neurofibrillary pathology, whether the formation of filaments or the preceding abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is the inhibitory entity that leads to neurodegeneration has been elusive. We have previously shown that cytosolic abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in AD brain (AD P-tau) sequesters normal tau (N-tau), microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1, and MAP2, which results in the inhibition of microtubule assembly and disruption of microtubules. Here, we show that polymerization of AD P-tau into filaments inhibits its ability to bind N-tau and as well as the ability to inhibit the assembly of tubulin into microtubules in vitro and in the regenerating microtubule system from cultured cells. Like AD P-tau, the in vitro abnormally hyperphosphorylated recombinant brain N-tau binds N-tau and loses this binding activity on polymerization into filaments. Dissociation of the hyperphosphorylated N-tau filaments by ultrasonication restores its ability to bind N-tau. These findings suggest that the nonfibrillized P-tau is most likely the responsible entity for the disruption of microtubules in neurons in AD. The efforts in finding a therapeutic intervention for tau-induced neurodegeneration need to be directed either to prevent the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of this protein or to neutralize its binding to normal MAPs, rather than to prevent its aggregation into filaments.},

abstract = {The database of known protein three‐dimensional structures can be significantly increased by the use of sequence homology, based on the following observations. (1) The database of known sequences, currently at more than 12,000 proteins, is two orders of magnitude larger than the database of known structures. (2) The currently most powerful method of predicting protein structures is model building by homology. (3) Structural homology can be inferred from the level of sequence similarity. (4) The threshold of sequence similarity sufficient for structural homology depends strongly on the length of the alignment. Here, we first quantify the relation between sequence similarity, structure similarity, and alignment length by an exhaustive survey of alignments between proteins of known structure and report a homology threshold curve as a function of alignment length. We then produce a database of homology‐derived secondary structure of proteins (HSSP) by aligning to each protein of known structure all sequences deemed homologous on the basis of the threshold curve. For each known protein structure, the derived database contains the aligned sequences, secondary structure, sequence variability, and sequence profile. Tertiary structures of the aligned sequences are implied, but not modeled explicity. The database effectively increases the number of known protein structures by a factor of five to more than 1800. The results may be useful in assessing the structural significance of matches in sequence database searches, in deriving preferences and patterns for structure prediction, in elucidating the structural role of conserved residues, and in modeling three‐dimensional detail by homology.

abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years the number of human genetic variants deposited into the publicly available databases has been increasing exponentially. The latest version of dbSNP, for example, contains {\~{}}50 million validated Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). SNVs make up most of human variation and are often the primary causes of disease. The non-synonymous SNVs (nsSNVs) result in single amino acid substitutions and may affect protein function, often causing disease. Although several methods for the detection of nsSNV effects have already been developed, the consistent increase in annotated data is offering the opportunity to improve prediction accuracy. RESULTS Here we present a new approach for the detection of disease-associated nsSNVs (Meta-SNP) that integrates four existing methods: PANTHER, PhD-SNP, SIFT and SNAP. We first tested the accuracy of each method using a dataset of 35,766 disease-annotated mutations from 8,667 proteins extracted from the SwissVar database. The four methods reached overall accuracies of 64{\%}-76{\%} with a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.38-0.53. We then used the outputs of these methods to develop a machine learning based approach that discriminates between disease-associated and polymorphic variants (Meta-SNP). In testing, the combined method reached 79{\%} overall accuracy and 0.59 MCC, {\~{}}3{\%} higher accuracy and {\~{}}0.05 higher correlation with respect to the best-performing method. Moreover, for the hardest-to-define subset of nsSNVs, i.e. variants for which half of the predictors disagreed with the other half, Meta-SNP attained 8{\%} higher accuracy than the best predictor. CONCLUSIONS Here we find that the Meta-SNP algorithm achieves better performance than the best single predictor. This result suggests that the methods used for the prediction of variant-disease associations are orthogonal, encoding different biologically relevant relationships. Careful combination of predictions from various resources is therefore a good strategy for the selection of high reliability predictions. Indeed, for the subset of nsSNVs where all predictors were in agreement (46{\%} of all nsSNVs in the set), our method reached 87{\%} overall accuracy and 0.73 MCC.

abstract = {GABA(A) receptor function can be conceptually divided into interactions between ligand and receptor (binding) and the opening and closing of the ligand-bound channel (gating). The relationship between binding, gating, and receptor structure remains unclear. Studies of mutations have identified many amino acid residues that contribute to the GABAbinding site. Most of these studies assayed changes in GABA dose-response curves, which are macroscopic measures that depend on the interplay of many processes and cannot resolve individual microscopic transitions. Understanding the microscopic basis of binding and gating is critical, because kinetic transition rates predict how receptors will behave at synapses. Furthermore, microscopic rates are directly related to the molecular interactions underlying receptor function. Here, we focused on a residue (beta2-R207) previously identified as lining the GABA-binding site that, when mutated to cysteine, greatly reduces apparent GABA affinity and was predicted to affect both binding and gating. To better understand the role of beta2-R207, we expressed alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2-R207C receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and studied receptor kinetics using fast solution applications. The mutation accelerated deactivation by 10-fold, without altering desensitization in the presence of saturating GABA. Maximum open probability and single-channel open times were also unaltered by the mutation, but the GABA-binding rate was reduced eightfold. Therefore, the effects of this mutation in a predicted binding site residue are solely attributable to changes in GABA-binding and unbinding kinetics, with no changes in channel gating. Because beta2-R207 stabilizes GABA in the binding pocket, it may directly contact the GABA molecule.},

abstract = {The advance of next-generation sequencing technologies has made exome sequencing  rapid and relatively inexpensive. A major application of exome sequencing is the identification of genetic variations likely to cause Mendelian diseases. This requires processing large amounts of sequence information and therefore computational approaches that can accurately and efficiently identify the subset of disease-associated variations are needed. The accuracy and high false positive rates of existing computational tools leave much room for improvement. Here, we develop a boosted tree regression machine-learning approach to predict human disease-associated amino acid variations by utilizing a comprehensive combination of protein sequence and structure features. On comparing our method, ENTPRISE, to the state-of-the-art methods SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MUTATIONASSESSOR, MUTATIONTASTER, FATHMM, ENTPRISE exhibits significant improvement. In particular, on a testing dataset consisting of only proteins with balanced disease-associated and neutral variations defined as having the ratio of neutral/disease-associated variations between 0.3 and 3, the Mathews Correlation Coefficient by ENTPRISE is 0.493 as compared to 0.432 by PPH2-HumVar, 0.406 by SIFT, 0.403 by MUTATIONASSESSOR, 0.402 by PPH2-HumDiv, 0.305 by MUTATIONTASTER, and 0.181 by FATHMM.

Details of their underlying ion selectivity properties are still not fully understood and are a matter of debate in the absence of high-resolution structures. To reveal the structural mechanism of ion selectivity in CNG channels, particularly their Ca(2+) blockage property, we engineered a set of mimics of CNG channel pores for both structural and functional analysis. The mimics faithfully represent the CNG channels they are modeled after, permeate Na(+) and K(+) equally well, and exhibit the same Ca(2+) blockage and permeation properties. Their high-resolution structures reveal a hitherto unseen selectivity filter architecture comprising three contiguous ion binding sites in which Na(+) and K(+) bind with different ion-ligand geometries. Our structural analysis reveals that the conserved acidic residue in the filter is essential for Ca(2+) binding but not through direct ion chelation as in the currently accepted view. Furthermore, structural insight from our CNG mimics allows us to pinpoint equivalent interactions in CNG channels through structure-based mutagenesis that have previously not been predicted using NaK or K(+) channel models.},

abstract = {Trialkylphosphines are powerful and selective reductants for disulfides, but until recently, they have not been commonly used in the life sciences due to their being malodorous and/or water insoluble. The commercial availability of tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), which is odorless and water soluble, makes this reagent safe and convenient to use. TCEP rapidly and stoichiometrically reduces most peptide or other disulfides, even under acidic conditions (2). Furthermore, aqueous solutions of TCEP are reasonably stable, and the functional concentration of TCEP is easily determined using 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Some early reports suggested that TCEP was unreactive with electrophilic maleimides and haloacyl groups commonly used in bioconjugate cross-linking reactions. However, recently it has been suggested that TCEP reacts with both these groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A global map of protein-protein interactions in cellular systems provides key insights into the workings of an organism. A repository of well-validated high-quality protein-protein interactions can be used in both large- and small-scale studies to generate and validate a wide range of functional hypotheses. RESULTS We develop HINT (http://hint.yulab.org) - a database of high-quality protein-protein interactomes for human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Oryza sativa. These were collected from several databases and filtered both systematically and manually to remove low-quality/erroneous interactions. The resulting datasets are classified by type (binary physical interactions vs. co-complex associations) and data source (high-throughput systematic setups vs. literature-curated small-scale experiments). We find strong sociological sampling biases in literature-curated datasets of small-scale interactions. An interactome without such sampling biases was used to understand network properties of human disease-genes - hubs are unlikely to cause disease, but if they do, they usually cause multiple disorders. CONCLUSIONS HINT is of significant interest to researchers in all fields of biology as it addresses the ubiquitous need of having a repository of high-quality protein-protein interactions. These datasets can be utilized to generate specific hypotheses about specific proteins and/or pathways, as well as analyzing global properties of cellular networks. HINT will be regularly updated and all versions will be tracked.},

abstract = {Proteins are classified into families based on evolutionary relationships and common structure-function characteristics. Availability of large data sets of gene-derived protein sequences drives this classification. Sequence space is exponentially large, making it difficult to characterize family differences. In this work, we show that Machine Learning (ML) methods can be trained to distinguish between protein families. A number of supervised ML algorithms are explored to this end. The most accurate is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classification method that accounts for the sequence context of the amino acids. Sequences for a number of protein families where there are sufficient data to be used in ML are studied. By splitting the data into training and testing sets, we find that this LSTM classifier can be trained to successfully classify the test sequences for all pairs of the families. Also investigated is whether the addition of structural information increases the accuracy of the binary comparisons. It does, but because there is much less available structural than sequence information, the quality of the training degrades. Another variety of LSTM, LSTM-wordGen, a context-dependent word generation algorithm, is used to generate new protein sequences based on seed sequences for the families considered here. Using the original sequences as training data and the generated sequences as test data, the LSTM classification method classifies the generated sequences almost as accurately as the true family members do. Thus, in principle, we have generated new members of these protein families.},

abstract = {We report the first comparison of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T field strengths using steady state free precession (SSFP) and fast low angle shot (FLASH) cine sequences. Cardiac volumes and mass measurements were assessed for feasibility, reproducibility and validity at each given field strength using FLASH and SSFP sequences. Ten healthy volunteers underwent retrospectively electrocardiogram (ECG) gated CMR at 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T using FLASH and SSFP sequences. B1 and B0 shimming and frequency scouts were used to optimise image quality. Cardiac volume and mass measurements were not significantly affected by field strength when using the same imaging sequence (P {\textgreater} 0.05 for all parameters at 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T). SSFP imaging returned larger end diastolic and end systolic volumes and smaller left ventricular masses than FLASH imaging at 7 T, and at the lower field strengths (P {\textless} 0.05 for each parameter). However, univariate general linear model analysis with fixed effects for sequence and field strengths found an interaction between imaging sequence and field strength (P = 0.03), with a smaller difference in volumes and mass measurements between SSFP and FLASH imaging at 7 T than 1.5 T and 3 T. SSFP and FLASH cine imaging at 7 T is technically feasible and provides valid assessment of cardiac volumes and mass compared with CMR imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T field strengths.

@article{Hansen2011,
abstract = {The regulation of ion channel activity by specific lipid molecules is widely recognized as an integral component of electrical signalling in cells. In particular, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), a minor yet dynamic phospholipid component of cell membranes, is known to regulate many different ion channels. PIP(2) is the primary agonist for classical inward rectifier (Kir2) channels, through which this lipid can regulate a cell's resting membrane potential. However, the molecular mechanism by which PIP(2) exerts its action is unknown. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of a Kir2.2 channel in complex with a short-chain (dioctanoyl) derivative of PIP(2). We found that PIP(2) binds at an interface between the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic domain (CTD). The PIP(2)-binding site consists of a conserved non-specific phospholipid-binding region in the TMD and a specific phosphatidylinositol-binding region in the CTD. On PIP(2) binding, a flexible expansion linker contracts to a compact helical structure, the CTD translates 6 {\AA} and becomes tethered to the TMD and the inner helix gate begins to open. In contrast, the small anionic lipid dioctanoyl glycerol pyrophosphatidic acid (PPA) also binds to the non-specific TMD region, but not to the specific phosphatidylinositol region, and thus fails to engage the CTD or open the channel. Our results show how PIP(2) can control the resting membrane potential through a specific ion-channel-receptor-ligand interaction that brings about a large conformational change, analogous to neurotransmitter activation of ion channels at synapses.},

Hydra have the ability to decouple the aging process from their life history and therefore provide us with a unique opportunity to gain insight into the aging process not only for basal hydrozoans but also for other species across the tree of life. We argue that under steady feeding and asexual reproduction Hydra species are able to escape aging as a result of high levels of cell proliferation and regenerative ability. We further highlight cellular processes for stem cell maintenance, such as the telomere dynamic, which prevent the accumulation of damage and protect against diseases and pathogens that mediate this condition. In addition, we discuss the causes of aging in other Hydra species.},

This survey aimed to assess drug users' views of the harms of drugs using the same scale. As users' drug choices are not solely based on harms, we additionally assessed perceived benefits. The survey was hosted at http://www.nationaldrugsurvey.org. UK residents reported their experience of 20 commonly used substances; those with direct experience of a substance rated its physical, dependence-related and social harms as well as benefits. A total of 1501 users completed the survey. There was no correlation between the classification of the 20 drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act and ranking of harms by users. Despite being unclassified substances, alcohol, solvents and tobacco were rated within the top ten most harmful drugs. There was a remarkably high correlation (r = 0.896) overall between rankings by users' and by experts. Ecstasy, cannabis and LSD were ranked highest by users on both acute and chronic benefits. These findings imply that users are relatively well informed about the harms associated with the drugs they use. They also suggest that the current UK legal classification system is not acting to inform users of the harms of psychoactive substances.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels catalyse rapid, highly selective influx of Ca(2+) into cells despite a 70-fold higher extracellular concentration of Na(+). How CaV channels solve this fundamental biophysical problem remains unclear. Here we report physiological and crystallographic analyses of a calcium selectivity filter constructed in the homotetrameric bacterial NaV channel NaVAb. Our results reveal interactions of hydrated Ca(2+) with two high-affinity Ca(2+)-binding sites followed by a third lower-affinity site that would coordinate Ca(2+) as it moves inward. At the selectivity filter entry, Site 1 is formed by four carboxyl side chains, which have a critical role in determining Ca(2+) selectivity. Four carboxyls plus four backbone carbonyls form Site 2, which is targeted by the blocking cations Cd(2+) and Mn(2+), with single occupancy. The lower-affinity Site 3 is formed by four backbone carbonyls alone, which mediate exit into the central cavity. This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca(2+) ions bound in the selectivity filter and supports a 'knock-off' mechanism of ion permeation through a stepwise-binding process. The multi-ion selectivity filter of our CaVAb model establishes a structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion selectivity and conductance by vertebrate CaV channels.},

Large-scale screens utilizing a neurodegenerative phenotype induced by eye-specific overexpression of human Tau have identified several kinases and phosphatases, apoptotic regulators and cytoskeleton proteins as determinants of Tau toxicity in vivo. The APP ortholog of Drosophila (dAPPl) shares the characteristic domains with vertebrate APP family members, but does not contain the human A$\beta$42 domain. To circumvent this drawback, researches have developed strategies by either direct secretion of human A$\beta$42 or triple transgenic flies expressing human APP, $\beta$-secretase and Drosophila $\gamma$-secretase presenilin (dPsn).

abstract = {Antigen immunodominance is an unexplained feature of CD8+ T cell responses to herpesviruses, which are agents whose lytic replication involves the sequential expression of immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L) proteins. Here, we analyze the primary CD8 response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection for reactivity to 2 IE proteins, 11 representative E proteins, and 10 representative L proteins, across a range of HLA backgrounds. Responses were consistently skewed toward epitopes in IE and a subset of E proteins, with only occasional responses to novel epitopes in L proteins. CD8+ T cell clones to representative IE, E, and L epitopes were assayed against EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) containing lytically infected cells. This showed direct recognition of lytically infected cells by all three sets of effectors but at markedly different levels, in the order IE {\textgreater} E {\textgreater} L, indicating that the efficiency of epitope presentation falls dramatically with progress of the lytic cycle. Thus, EBV lytic cycle antigens display a hierarchy of immunodominance that directly reflects the efficiency of their presentation in lytically infected cells; the CD8+ T cell response thereby focuses on targets whose recognition leads to maximal biologic effect.},

abstract = {Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is essential for the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), and a germline defect in the pathway results in FA, a cancer predisposition syndrome driven by genome instability. Central to this pathway is the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, which coordinates multiple DNA repair activities required for the resolution of ICLs. Recent studies have demonstrated how the FA pathway coordinates three critical DNA repair processes, including nucleolytic incision, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and homologous recombination (HR). Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the downstream ICL repair steps initiated by ubiquitin-mediated FA pathway activation.},

abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19{\%} of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82{\%} of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

abstract = {The MRE11-RAD50-Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1 [MRN]) complex accumulates at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in microscopically discernible nuclear foci. Focus formation by the MRN complex is dependent on MDC1, a large nuclear protein that directly interacts with phosphorylated H2AX. In this study, we identified a region in MDC1 that is essential for the focal accumulation of the MRN complex at sites of DNA damage. This region contains multiple conserved acidic sequence motifs that are constitutively phosphorylated in vivo. We show that these motifs are efficiently phosphorylated by caseine kinase 2 (CK2) in vitro and directly interact with the N-terminal forkhead-associated domain of NBS1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mutation of these conserved motifs in MDC1 or depletion of CK2 by small interfering RNA disrupts the interaction between MDC1 and NBS1 and abrogates accumulation of the MRN complex at sites of DNA DSBs in vivo. Thus, our data reveal the mechanism by which MDC1 physically couples the MRN complex to damaged chromatin.},

abstract = {Inhibitory receptors have been proposed to modulate the in vivo cytotoxic response against tumor targets for both spontaneous and antibody-dependent pathways. Using a variety of syngenic and xenograft models, we demonstrate here that the inhibitory FcgammaRIIB molecule is a potent regulator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo, modulating the activity of FcgammaRIII on effector cells. Although many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the anti-tumor activities of therapeutic antibodies, including extended half-life, blockade of signaling pathways, activation of apoptosis and effector-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we show here that engagement of Fcgamma receptors on effector cells is a dominant component of the in vivo activity of antibodies against tumors. Mouse monoclonal antibodies, as well as the humanized, clinically effective therapeutic agents trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)) and rituximab (Rituxan(R)), engaged both activation (FcgammaRIII) and inhibitory (FcgammaRIIB) antibody receptors on myeloid cells, thus modulating their cytotoxic potential. Mice deficient in FcgammaRIIB showed much more antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; in contrast, mice deficient in activating Fc receptors as well as antibodies engineered to disrupt Fc binding to those receptors were unable to arrest tumor growth in vivo. These results demonstrate that Fc-receptor-dependent mechanisms contribute substantially to the action of cytotoxic antibodies against tumors and indicate that an optimal antibody against tumors would bind preferentially to activation Fc receptors and minimally to the inhibitory partner FcgammaRIIB.},

abstract = {Accurate modelling of biological systems requires a deeper and more complete knowledge about the molecular components and their functional associations than we currently have. Traditionally, new knowledge on protein associations generated by experiments has played a central role in systems modelling, in contrast to generally less trusted bio-computational predictions. However, we will not achieve realistic modelling of complex molecular systems if the current experimental designs lead to biased screenings of real protein networks and leave large, functionally important areas poorly characterised. To assess the likelihood of this, we have built comprehensive network models of the yeast and human proteomes by using a meta-statistical integration of diverse computationally predicted protein association datasets. We have compared these predicted networks against combined experimental datasets from seven biological resources at different level of statistical significance. These eukaryotic predicted networks resemble all the topological and noise features of the experimentally inferred networks in both species, and we also show that this observation is not due to random behaviour. In addition, the topology of the predicted networks contains information on true protein associations, beyond the constitutive first order binary predictions. We also observe that most of the reliable predicted protein associations are experimentally uncharacterised in our models, constituting the hidden or "dark matter" of networks by analogy to astronomical systems. Some of this dark matter shows enrichment of particular functions and contains key functional elements of protein networks, such as hubs associated with important functional areas like the regulation of Ras protein signal transduction in human cells. Thus, characterising this large and functionally important dark matter, elusive to established experimental designs, may be crucial for modelling biological systems. In any case, these predictions provide a valuable guide to these experimentally elusive regions.},

Regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly reflecting more-extended control regions. Some 43{\%} of the genes contain introns, of which there are 4,730. Fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes; half of these are cancer related. We identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton, compartmentation, cell-cycle control, proteolysis, protein phosphorylation and RNA splicing. These genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life. Few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified, suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization.},

Loss of ATM or failure of its activation in humans and mice lead to defective cellular responses to DSBs, such as cell cycle checkpoints, radiation sensitivity, immune dysfunction, infertility and cancer predisposition. A widely used biological marker to identify the active form of ATM is the autophosphorylation of ATM at a single, conserved serine residue (Ser 1981 in humans; Ser 1987 in mouse). Here we show that Atm-dependent responses are functional at the organismal and cellular level in mice that express a mutant form of Atm (mutation of Ser to Ala at position 1987) as their sole Atm species. Moreover, the mutant protein does not exhibit dominant-negative interfering activity when expressed physiologically or overexpressed in the context of Atm heterozygous mice. These results suggest an alternative mode for stimulation of Atm by DSBs in which Atm autophosphorylation at Ser 1987, like trans-phosphorylation of downstream substrates, is a consequence rather than a cause of Atm activation.},

abstract = {Colicin B (55 kDa) is a cytotoxic protein that recognizes the outer membrane transporter, FepA, as a receptor and, after gaining access to the cytoplasmic membranes of sensitive Escherichia coli cells, forms a pore that depletes the electrochemical potential of the membrane and ultimately results in cell death. To begin to understand the series of dynamic conformational changes that must occur as colicin B translocates from outer membrane to cytoplasmic membrane, we report here the crystal structure of colicin B at 2.5 A resolution. The crystal belongs to the space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions a = 132.162 A, b = 138.167 A, c = 106.16 A. The overall structure of colicin B is dumbbell shaped. Unlike colicin Ia, the only other TonB-dependent colicin crystallized to date, colicin B does not have clearly structurally delineated receptor-binding and translocation domains. Instead, the unique N-terminal lobe of the dumbbell contains both domains and consists of a large (290 residues), mostly beta-stranded structure with two short alpha-helices. This is followed by a single long ( approximately 74 A) helix that connects the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal pore-forming domain, which is composed of 10 alpha-helices arranged in a bundle-type structure, similar to the pore-forming domains of other colicins. The TonB box sequence at the N-terminus folds back to interact with the N-terminal lobe of the dumbbell and leaves the flanking sequences highly disordered. Comparison of sequences among many colicins has allowed the identification of a putative receptor-binding domain.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are vital in the functioning of all ecosystems; however, most microorganisms are uncultivated, and their roles in natural systems are unclear. Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

abstract = {To reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac lineage determination and differentiation, we quantified the proteome of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), and cardiomyocytes during a time course of directed differentiation by label-free quantitative proteomics. This approach correctly identified known stage-specific markers of cardiomyocyte differentiation, including SRY-box2 (SOX2), GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), and myosin heavy chain 6 (MYH6). This led us to determine whether our proteomic screen could reveal previously unidentified mediators of heart development. We identified Disabled 2 (DAB2) as one of the most dynamically expressed proteins in hESCs, CPCs, and cardiomyocytes. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) mutagenesis in zebrafish to assess whether DAB2 plays a functional role during cardiomyocyte differentiation. We found that deletion of Dab2 in zebrafish embryos led to a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte number and increased endogenous WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling. Furthermore, the Dab2-deficient defects in cardiomyocyte number could be suppressed by overexpression of dickkopf 1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling. Thus, inhibition of WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling by DAB2 is essential for establishing the correct number of cardiomyocytes in the developing heart. Our work demonstrates that quantifying the proteome of human stem cells can identify previously unknown developmental regulators.},

InterPro integrates these signatures, capitalizing on the respective strengths of the individual databases, to produce a powerful protein classification resource. Here, we report on the status of InterPro as it enters its 15th year of operation, and give an overview of new developments with the database and its associated Web interfaces and software. In particular, the new domain architecture search tool is described and the process of mapping of Gene Ontology terms to InterPro is outlined. We also discuss the challenges faced by the resource given the explosive growth in sequence data in recent years.

abstract = {Synaptic receptors are allosteric proteins that switch on and off to regulate cell signalling. Here, we use single-channel electrophysiology to measure and map energy changes in the gating conformational change of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Two separated regions in the $\alpha$-subunits--the transmitter-binding sites and $\alpha$M2-$\alpha$M3 linkers in the membrane domain--have the highest ϕ-values (change conformation the earliest), followed by the extracellular domain, most of the membrane domain and the gate. Large gating-energy changes occur at the transmitter-binding sites, $\alpha$-subunit interfaces, the $\alpha$M1 helix and the gate. We hypothesize that rearrangements of the linkers trigger the global allosteric transition, and that the hydrophobic gate unlocks in three steps. The mostly local character of side-chain energy changes and the similarly high ϕ-values of separated domains, both with and without ligands, suggest that gating is not strictly a mechanical process initiated by the affinity change for the agonist.},

abstract = {The human host survives many infectious challenges in the absence of preexisting specific (adaptive) immunity because of the existence of a separate set of protective mechanisms that do not depend on specific antigenic recognition. These antigen-independent mechanisms constitute innate immunity. Antimicrobial peptides are released at epithelial surfaces and disrupt the membranes of many microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors on epithelial cells and leukocytes recognize a range of microbial molecular patterns and generate intracellular signals for activation of a range of host responses. Cytokines released from leukocytes and other cells exhibit a vast array of regulatory functions in both adaptive and innate immunity. Chemokines released from infected tissues recruit diverse populations of leukocytes that express distinct chemokine receptors. Natural killer cells recognize and bind virus-infected host cells and tumor cells and induce their apoptosis. Complement, through the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways, mediates antibody-independent opsonization, phagocyte recruitment, and microbial lysis. Phagocytes migrate from the microcirculation into infected tissue and ingest and kill invading microbes. These innate immune mechanisms and their interactions in defense against infection provide the host with the time needed to mobilize the more slowly developing mechanisms of adaptive immunity, which might protect against subsequent challenges.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is crucial for glucose homeostasis in mammalian cells. The current understanding of PDC regulation involves inhibitory serine phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by PDH kinase (PDK), whereas dephosphorylation of PDH by PDH phosphatase (PDP) activates PDC. Here, we report that lysine acetylation of PDHA1 and PDP1 is common in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells and diverse human cancer cells. K321 acetylation inhibits PDHA1 by recruiting PDK1, and K202 acetylation inhibits PDP1 by dissociating its substrate PDHA1, both of which are important in promoting glycolysis in cancer cells and consequent tumor growth. Moreover, we identified mitochondrial ACAT1 and SIRT3 as the upstream acetyltransferase and deacetylase, respectively, of PDHA1 and PDP1, while knockdown of ACAT1 attenuates tumor growth. Furthermore, Y381 phosphorylation of PDP1 dissociates SIRT3 and recruits ACAT1 to PDC. Together, hierarchical, distinct posttranslational modifications act in concert to control molecular composition of PDC and contribute to the Warburg effect.},

abstract = {The translocation of protein toxins into a cell relies on a myriad of protein-protein interactions. One such group of toxins are enzymatic E colicins, protein antibiotics produced by Escherichia coli in times of stress. These proteins subvert ordinary nutrient uptake mechanisms to enter the cell and unleash nuclease activity. We, and others, have previously shown that uptake of ColE9 (colicin E9) is dependent on engagement of the OM (outer membrane) receptors BtuB and OmpF as well as recruitment of the periplasmic protein TolB, forming a large supramolecular complex. Intriguingly, colicins bind TolB using a natively disordered region to mimic the interaction of TolB with Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein). This is thought to trigger OM instability and prime the system for translocation. Here, we review key interactions in the assembly of this 'colicin translocon' and discuss the key role disorder plays in achieving uptake.},

abstract = {Continuum solvation models, such as Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Born methods, have become increasingly popular tools for investigating the influence of electrostatics on biomolecular structure, energetics and dynamics. However, the use of such methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum electrostatics calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address this problem, we have developed the PDB2PQR web service (http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/). This server automates many of the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, including adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules in a manner consistent with favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating 'PQR' output compatible with several popular computational biology packages. This service is intended to facilitate the setup and execution of electrostatics calculations for both experts and non-experts and thereby broaden the accessibility to the biological community of continuum electrostatics analyses of biomolecular systems.},

abstract = {The RUNX1 transcription factor is widely recognised for its tumour suppressor effects in leukaemia. Recently a putative link to breast cancer has started to emerge, however the function of RUNX1 in breast cancer is still unknown. To investigate if RUNX1 expression was important to clinical outcome in primary breast tumours a tissue microarray (TMA) containing biopsies from 483 patients with primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer was stained by immunohistochemistry. RUNX1 was associated with progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumours (P{\textless}0.05), more tumour CD4+(P{\textless}0.05) and CD8+(P{\textless}0.01) T-lymphocytic infiltrate, increased tumour CD138+plasma cell (P{\textless}0.01) and more CD68+macrophage infiltrate (P{\textless}0.001). RUNX1 expression did not influence outcome of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or HER2-positive disease, however on univariate analysis a high RUNX1 protein was significantly associated with poorer cancer-specific survival in patients with ER-negative (P{\textless}0.05) and with triple negative (TN) invasive breast cancer (P{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis of cancer-specific survival showed a trend towards significance in ER-negative patients (P{\textless}0.1) and was significant in triple negative patients (P{\textless}0.05). Of relevance, triple negative breast cancer currently lacks good biomarkers and patients with this subtype do not benefit from the option of targeted therapy unlike patients with ER-positive or HER2-positive disease. Using multivariate analysis RUNX1 was identified as an independent prognostic marker in the triple negative subgroup. Overall, our study identifies RUNX1 as a new prognostic indicator correlating with poor prognosis specifically in the triple negative subtype of human breast cancer.},

Sections from temporal cortex of 70 DS cases aged 3 to 73 years were examined immunohistochemicallyf or immunoreactivity (IR) for the Abeta N-terminal, the Abeta40 C-terminus and the Abeta42 C-terminus. N-terminal antibodies did not detect intracellular Abeta. Abeta40 antibodies did not detect significant intracellular Abeta, but older cases showed Abeta40 IR in mature plaques. In contrast, Abeta42 antibodies revealed clear-cut intraneuronal IR. All Abeta42 antibodies tested showed strong intraneuronal Abeta42 IR in very young DS patients, especially in theyoungest cases studied (e.g., 3 or 4yr. old), but this IR declined as extracellular Abeta plaques gradually accumulated and matured. No inflammatory changes were associated with intraneuronal Abeta. We also studied the temporal development of gliosis and NFT formation, revealing that in DS temporal cortex, inflammation and NFT follow Abeta deposition. We conclude that Abeta42 accumulates intracellularly prior to extracellular Abeta deposition in Down syndrome, and that subsequent maturation of extracellular Abeta deposits elicits inflammatory responses andprecedes NFTs.},

abstract = {The design of enzyme-like catalysts tests our understanding of sequence-to-structure/function relationships in proteins. Here we install hydrolytic activity predictably into a completely de novo and thermostable $\alpha$-helical barrel, which comprises seven helices arranged around an accessible channel. We show that the lumen of the barrel accepts 21 mutations to functional polar residues. The resulting variant, which has cysteine–histidine–glutamic acid triads on each helix, hydrolyses p-nitrophenyl acetate with catalytic efficiencies that match the most-efficient redesigned hydrolases based on natural protein scaffolds. This is the first report of a functional catalytic triad engineered into a de novo protein framework. The flexibility of our system also allows the facile incorporation of unnatural side chains to improve activity and probe the catalytic mechanism. Such a predictable and robust construction of truly de novo biocatalysts holds promise for applications in chemical and biochemical synthesis.},

abstract = {A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/.},

abstract = {Conventional antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are heterogeneous mixtures of chemically distinct molecules that vary in both drugs/antibody (DAR) and conjugation sites. Sub-optimal properties of heterogeneous ADCs have led to new site-specific conjugation methods for improving ADC homogeneity. Most site-specific methods require extensive antibody engineering to identify optimal conjugation sites and introduce unique functional groups for conjugation with appropriately modified linkers. Alternative non-recombinant methods have emerged in which bifunctional linkers are utilized to cross-link antibody interchain cysteines and afford ADCs containing four drugs/antibody. Although these methods have been shown to improve ADC homogeneity and stability in vitro, their effect on the pharmacological properties of ADCs in vivo is unknown. In order to determine the relative impact of interchain cysteine cross-linking on the therapeutic window and other properties of ADCs in vivo, we synthesized a derivative of the known ADC payload, MC-MMAF that contains a bifunctional dibromomaleimide (DBM) linker instead of a conventional maleimide (MC) linker. The DBM-MMAF derivative was conjugated to trastuzumab and a novel anti-CD98 antibody to afford ADCs containing predominantly four drugs/antibody. The pharmacological properties of the resulting cross-linked ADCs were compared with analogous heterogeneous ADCs derived from conventional linkers. The results demonstrate that DBM linkers can be applied directly to native antibodies, without antibody engineering, to yield highly homogeneous ADCs via cysteine cross-linking. The resulting ADCs demonstrate improved pharmacokinetics, superior efficacy, and reduced toxicity in vivo compared to analogous conventional heterogeneous ADCs.},

abstract = {Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced synthetic polymers and is accumulating in the environment at a staggering rate as discarded packaging and textiles. The properties that make PET so useful also endow it with an alarming resistance to biodegradation, likely lasting centuries in the environment. Our collective reliance on PET and other plastics means that this buildup will continue unless solutions are found. Recently, a newly discovered bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was shown to exhibit the rare ability to grow on PET as a major carbon and energy source. Central to its PET biodegradation capability is a secreted PETase (PET-digesting enzyme). Here, we present a 0.92 {\AA} resolution X-ray crystal structure of PETase, which reveals features common to both cutinases and lipases. PETase retains the ancestral $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold but exhibits a more open active-site cleft than homologous cutinases. By narrowing the binding cleft via mutation of two active-site residues to conserved amino acids in cutinases, we surprisingly observe improved PET degradation, suggesting that PETase is not fully optimized for crystalline PET degradation, despite presumably evolving in a PET-rich environment. Additionally, we show that PETase degrades another semiaromatic polyester, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), which is an emerging, bioderived PET replacement with improved barrier properties. In contrast, PETase does not degrade aliphatic polyesters, suggesting that it is generally an aromatic polyesterase. These findings suggest that additional protein engineering to increase PETase performance is realistic and highlight the need for further developments of structure/activity relationships for biodegradation of synthetic polyesters.},

The pink salmon MHC class I extracellular domains show 84.2{\%} amino acid identity with those of Atlantic salmon (Sasa p30). polymorphism of the MHC class I alpha 1 domain was determined using PCR with genomic DNA from 12 fish. Sixteen variants were identified with most diversity concentrated in those amino acids that bind directly to peptides in mammalian class I molecules.

abstract = {Crystal structures of the lactose permease of Escherichia coli (LacY) reveal 12, mostly irregular transmembrane $\alpha$-helices surrounding a large cavity open to the cytoplasm and a tightly sealed periplasmic side (inward-facing conformation) with the sugar-binding site at the apex of the cavity and inaccessible from the periplasm. However, LacY is highly dynamic, and binding of a galactopyranoside causes closing of the inward-facing cavity with opening of a complementary outward-facing cavity. Therefore, the coupled, electrogenic translocation of a sugar and a proton across the cytoplasmic membrane via LacY very likely involves a global conformational change that allows alternating access of sugar- and H(+)-binding sites to either side of the membrane. Here the various biochemical and biophysical approaches that provide strong support for the alternating access mechanism are reviewed. Evidence is also presented indicating that opening of the periplasmic cavity is probably the limiting step for binding and perhaps transport.},

This effect of the FAD-linked mutations is likely to be directly related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because A??42 is deposited early and selectively in the senile plaques that are an invariant feature of all forms of AD. Thus our results provide strong evidence that the FAD-linked mutations all cause AD by increasing the extracellular concentration of A??42 (43), thereby fostering A?? deposition, and they support the hypothesis that cerebral A?? deposition is an essential early event in the pathogenesis of all forms of AD. Interactions between the basal forebrain cholinergic system and A?? that could influence AD pathogenesis are discussed.},

abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

abstract = {Background Potassium ion homeostasis plays an important role in regulating membrane potential and therefore resistance to cations, antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and other yeasts. However, the precise relationship between drug resistance in S. pombe and external potassium concentrations (particularly in its natural habitats) remains unclear. S. pombe can tolerate a wide range of external potassium concentrations which in turn affect plasma membrane polarization. We thus hypothesized that high external potassium concentrations suppress the sensitivity of this yeast to various drugs. Methods We have investigated the effect of external KCl concentrations on the sensitivity of S. pombe cells to a wide range of antibiotics, antimicrobial agents and chemotherapeutic drugs. We employed survival assays, immunoblotting and microscopy for these studies. Results We demonstrate that KCl, and to a lesser extent NaCl and RbCl can suppress the sensitivity of S. pombe to a wide range of antibiotics. Ammonium chloride and potassium hydrogen sulphate also suppressed drug sensitivity. This effect appears to depend in part on changes to membrane polarization and membrane transport proteins. Interestingly, we have found little relationship between the suppressive effect of KCl on sensitivity and the structure, polarity or solubility of the various compounds investigated. Conclusions High concentrations of external potassium and other cations suppress sensitivity to a wide range of drugs in S. pombe. Potassium-rich environments may thus provide S. pombe a competitive advantage in nature. Modulating potassium ion homeostasis may sensitize pathogenic fungi to antifungal agents.},

abstract = {Background: Mapping of orthologous genes among species serves an important role in functional genomics by allowing researchers to develop hypotheses about gene function in one species based on what is known about the functions of orthologs in other species. Several tools for predicting orthologous gene relationships are available. However, these tools can give different results and identification of predicted orthologs is not always straightforward.Results: We report a simple but effective tool, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt), for rapid identification of orthologs. DIOPT integrates existing approaches, facilitating rapid identification of orthologs among human, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae. As compared to individual tools, DIOPT shows increased sensitivity with only a modest decrease in specificity. Moreover, the flexibility built into the DIOPT graphical user interface allows researchers with different goals to appropriately 'cast a wide net' or limit results to highest confidence predictions. DIOPT also displays protein and domain alignments, including percent amino acid identity, for predicted ortholog pairs. This helps users identify the most appropriate matches among multiple possible orthologs. To facilitate using model organisms for functional analysis of human disease-associated genes, we used DIOPT to predict high-confidence orthologs of disease genes in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and genes in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets. The results are accessible through the DIOPT diseases and traits query tool. Conclusions: DIOPT and DIOPT-DIST are useful resources for researchers working with model organisms, especially those who are interested in exploiting model organisms such as Drosophila to study the functions of human disease genes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Hu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in Western societies. It progresses asymptomatically during decades before being belatedly diagnosed when therapeutic strategies have become unviable. Although several genetic alterations have been associated with AD, the vast majority of AD cases do not show strong genetic underpinnings and are thus considered a consequence of non-genetic factors. Epigenetic mechanisms allow for the integration of long-lasting non-genetic inputs on specific genetic backgrounds, and recently, a growing number of epigenetic alterations in AD have been described. For instance, an accumulation of dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms in aging, the predominant risk factor of AD, might facilitate the onset of the disease. Likewise, mutations in several enzymes of the epigenetic machinery have been associated with neurodegenerative processes that are altered in AD such as impaired learning and memory formation. Genome-wide and locus-specific epigenetic alterations have also been reported, and several epigenetically dysregulated genes validated by independent groups. From these studies, a picture emerges of AD as being associated with DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, suggesting a general repressed chromatin state and epigenetically reduced plasticity in AD. Here we review these recent findings and discuss several technical and methodological considerations that are imperative for their correct interpretation. We also pay particular focus on potential implementations and theoretical frameworks that we expect will help to better direct future studies aimed to unravel the epigenetic participation in AD.},

PCNA in mammalian cells thus appears to play a key role in controlling several reactions through the coordination and organisation of different partners. Two major questions have emerged: how do these proteins access PCNA in a coordinated manner, and how does PCNA temporally and spatially organise their functions?

We present a domain-based method for protein function classification and prediction of functional sites that exploits functional sub-classification of CATH superfamilies. The superfamilies are sub-classified into functional families (FunFams) using a hierarchical clustering algorithm supervised by a new classification method, FunFHMMer. RESULTS FunFHMMer generates more functionally coherent groupings of protein sequences than other domain-based protein classifications. This has been validated using known functional information. The conserved positions predicted by the FunFams are also found to be enriched in known functional residues. Moreover, the functional annotations provided by the FunFams are found to be more precise than other domain-based resources. FunFHMMer currently identifies 110,439 FunFams in 2735 superfamilies which can be used to functionally annotate{\textgreater}16 million domain sequences.

@article{Yang2012,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Several measures have been recently proposed for quantifying the functional similarity between gene products according to well-structured controlled vocabularies where biological terms are organized in a tree or in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. However, existing semantic similarity measures ignore two important facts. First, when calculating the similarity between two terms, they disregard the descendants of these terms. While this makes no difference when the ontology is a tree, we shall show that it has important consequences when the ontology is a DAG-this is the case, for example, with the Gene Ontology (GO). Second, existing similarity measures do not model the inherent uncertainty which comes from the fact that our current knowledge of the gene annotation and of the ontology structure is incomplete. Here, we propose a novel approach based on downward random walks that can be used to improve any of the existing similarity measures to exhibit these two properties. The approach is computationally efficient-random walks do not need to be simulated as we provide formulas to calculate their stationary distributions. RESULTS: To show that our approach can potentially improve any semantic similarity measure, we test it on six different semantic similarity measures: three commonly used measures by Resnik (1999), Lin (1998), and Jiang and Conrath (1997); and three recently proposed measures: simUI, simGIC by Pesquita et al. (2008); GraSM by Couto et al. (2007); and Couto and Silva (2011). We applied these improved measures to the GO annotations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and tested how they correlate with sequence similarity, mRNA co-expression and protein-protein interaction data. Our results consistently show that the use of downward random walks leads to more reliable similarity measures.},

However, the regulatory mechanisms that couple chromatin sensing to DNA-damage signalling in mammalian cells are not well understood.

This triggers KAT5-mediated acetylation of the ATM kinase, promoting DNA-damage-checkpoint activation and cell survival. We also establish that chromatin alterations can themselves enhance KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and ATM-dependent signalling, and identify the proto-oncogene c-Abl as a mediator of this modification. These findings define KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation as a key event in the sensing of genomic and chromatin perturbations, and highlight a key role for c-Abl in such processes.},

abstract = {Many genetic variations are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Non-synonymous SNPs are 'neutral' if the resulting point-mutated protein is not functionally discernible from the wild type and 'non-neutral' otherwise. The ability to identify non-neutral substitutions could significantly aid targeting disease causing detrimental mutations, as well as SNPs that increase the fitness of particular phenotypes. Here, we introduced comprehensive data sets to assess the performance of methods that predict SNP effects. Along we introduced SNAP (screening for non-acceptable polymorphisms), a neural network-based method for the prediction of the functional effects of non-synonymous SNPs. SNAP needs only sequence information as input, but benefits from functional and structural annotations, if available. In a cross-validation test on over 80,000 mutants, SNAP identified 80{\%} of the non-neutral substitutions at 77{\%} accuracy and 76{\%} of the neutral substitutions at 80{\%} accuracy. This constituted an important improvement over other methods; the improvement rose to over ten percentage points for mutants for which existing methods disagreed. Possibly even more importantly SNAP introduced a well-calibrated measure for the reliability of each prediction. This measure will allow users to focus on the most accurate predictions and/or the most severe effects. Available at http://www.rostlab.org/services/SNAP.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic gene regulation is closely correlated with histone covalent modifications. Recently, histone H2B lysine-123 (H2B-K123) ubiquitination has been implicated in regulation of transcription as well as histone H3 lysine-4 (H3-K4) methylation which is further associated with active transcription. However, whether H2B-K123 ubiquitination controls transcription through regulation of H3-K4 methylation remains unknown under physiological conditions. Here, we show that H2B-K123 ubiquitination enhances the rate of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment to the coding sequence of an inducible yeast gene, GAL1. Consistently, GAL1 transcription is significantly impaired in absence of H2B-K123 ubiquitination. On the other hand, H3-K4 methylation does not alter the rate of elongating RNAPII recruitment at GAL1. Further, these covalent modifications do not regulate pre-initiation complex formation at GAL1. Collectively, our data demonstrate the function of H2B-K123 ubiquitination in regulation of transcriptional elongation independently of H3-K4 methylation in vivo, providing a new insight on epigenetic regulation of gene expression.},

The hydrolytic activity has been applied in the food industry for decades for reducing the lactose content in milk, while the transgalactosylation activity has been used to synthesize galacto-oligosaccharides and galactose containing chemicals in recent years. The main focus of this review is on the expression and production of Aspergillus niger, Kluyveromyces lactis and bacterial $\beta$-galactosidases in different microbial hosts. Furthermore, emphasis is given on the reported applications of the recombinant enzymes. Current developments on novel $\beta$-galactosidases, derived from newly identified microbial sources or by protein engineering means, together with the use of efficient recombinant microbial production systems are converting this enzyme into a relevant synthetic tool. Thermostable $\beta$-galactosidases (cold-adapted or thermophilic) in addition to the growing market for functional foods will likely redouble its industrial interest.},

Here we report the crystal structure of the Streptomyces lividans K(+) channel KcsA in its open-inactivated conformation and investigate the mechanism of C-type inactivation gating at the selectivity filter from channels 'trapped' in a series of partially open conformations. Five conformer classes were identified with openings ranging from 12 A in closed KcsA (Calpha-Calpha distances at Thr 112) to 32 A when fully open. They revealed a remarkable correlation between the degree of gate opening and the conformation and ion occupancy of the selectivity filter. We show that a gradual filter backbone reorientation leads first to a loss of the S2 ion binding site and a subsequent loss of the S3 binding site, presumably abrogating ion conduction. These structures indicate a molecular basis for C-type inactivation in K(+) channels.},

However, microbial genomes that are currently available are of limited phylogenetic breadth, owing to our historical inability to cultivate most microorganisms in the laboratory. We apply single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called 'microbial dark matter'. With this additional genomic information, we are able to resolve many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to phylogenetically anchor up to 20{\%} of metagenomic reads in some habitats, facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our planet. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4 {\AA} resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.},

abstract = {The protein kindlin 3 is mutated in the leukocyte adhesion deficiency III (LAD-III) disorder, leading to widespread infection due to the failure of leukocytes to migrate into infected tissue sites. To gain understanding of how kindlin 3 controls leukocyte function, we have focused on its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and find that deletion of this domain eliminates the ability of kindlin 3 to participate in adhesion and migration of B cells mediated by the leukocyte integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). PH domains are often involved in membrane localization of proteins through binding to phosphoinositides. We show that the kindlin 3 PH domain has binding affinity for phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 over PI(4,5)P2. It has a major role in membrane association of kindlin 3 that is enhanced by the binding of LFA-1 to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). A splice variant, kindlin 3-IPRR, has a four-residue insert in the PH domain at a critical site that influences phosphoinositide binding by enhancing binding to PI(4,5)P2 as well as by binding to PI(3,4,5)P3. However kindlin 3-IPRR is unable to restore the ability of LAD-III B cells to adhere to and migrate on LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1, potentially by altering the dynamics or PI specificity of binding to the membrane. Thus, the correct functioning of the kindlin 3 PH domain is central to the role that kindlin 3 performs in guiding lymphocyte adhesion and motility behavior, which in turn is required for a successful immune response.},

Two out of three arginines in S4 were located below the phenylalanine constituting the gating charge-transfer center.

Measurements with K+ and its slightly larger analogue, Rb+, lead us to conclude that the selectivity filter usually contains two K+ ions separated by one water molecule. The two ions move in a concerted fashion between two configurations, K+-water-K+-water (1,3 configuration) and water-K+-water-K+ (2,4 configuration), until a third ion enters, displacing the ion on the opposite side of the queue. For K+, the energy difference between the 1,3 and 2,4 configurations is close to zero, the condition of maximum conduction rate. The energetic balance between these configurations is a clear example of evolutionary optimization of protein function.},

To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

abstract = {A convenient in vitro chemical ligation strategy has been developed that allows folded recombinant proteins to be joined together. This strategy permits segmental, selective isotopic labeling of the product. The src homology type 3 and 2 domains (SH3 and SH2) of Abelson protein tyrosine kinase, which constitute the regulatory apparatus of the protein, were individually prepared in reactive forms that can be ligated together under normal protein-folding conditions to form a normal peptide bond at the ligation junction. This strategy was used to prepare NMR sample quantities of the Abelson protein tyrosine kinase-SH(32) domain pair, in which only one of the domains was labeled with 15N. Mass spectrometry and NMR analyses were used to confirm the structure of the ligated protein, which was also shown to have appropriate ligand-binding properties. The ability to prepare recombinant proteins with selectively labeled segments having a single-site mutation, by using a combination of expression of fusion proteins and chemical ligation in vitro, will increase the size limits for protein structural determination in solution with NMR methods. In vitro chemical ligation of expressed protein domains will also provide a combinatorial approach to the synthesis of linked protein domains.},

The recruitment of the transcriptional regulators and the transcription machinery to promoter chromatin is coordinated by a genetic code on the DNA and an epigenetic code on the histone proteins. Chromatin is not a stable environment; rather, the histones, the transcription regulatory proteins and the enzymes that modify and mobilise nucleosomes are in a dynamic state. Thus, at any one time, the factors associated with a region will cooperate or compete to change the rate of inter-conversion between permissive and non-permissive chromatin states, leading to activation or repression of transcription.

abstract = {Fragile-X mental retardation is caused by loss of function of a single gene encoding the Fragile-X mental retardation protein, FMRP, an RNA-binding protein that harbors two KH-type and one RGG-type RNA-binding domains. Previous studies identified intramolecular G-quartet RNAs as high-affinity targets for the RGG box, but the relationship of RNA binding to FMRP function and mental retardation remains unclear. One severely affected patient harbors a missense mutation (I304N) within the second KH domain (KH2), and some evidence suggests this domain may be involved in the proposed role of FMRP in translational regulation. We now identify the RNA target for the KH2 domain as a sequence-specific element within a complex tertiary structure termed the FMRP kissing complex. We demonstrate that the association of FMRP with brain polyribosomes is abrogated by competition with the FMRP kissing complex RNA, but not by high-affinity G-quartet RNAs. We conclude that mental retardation associated with the I304N mutation, and likely the Fragile-X syndrome more generally, may relate to a crucial role for RNAs harboring the kissing complex motif as targets for FMRP translational regulation.},

Large amounts of histones are required during the S phase of the cell cycle when genome replication occurs. However, ectopic expression of histones during other cell cycle phases is toxic; thus, histone expression is restricted to the S phase and is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of regulation of histone gene expression with emphasis on the transcriptional regulation of the replication-dependent histone genes in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Prevention and repair of DNA damage is essential for maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival. DNA replication during S-phase can be a source of DNA damage if endogenous or exogenous stresses impair the progression of replication forks. It has become increasingly clear that DNA-damage-response pathways do not only respond to the presence of damaged DNA, but also modulate DNA replication dynamics to prevent DNA damage formation during S-phase. Such observations may help explain the developmental defects or cancer predisposition caused by mutations in DNA-damage-response genes. The present review focuses on molecular mechanisms by which DNA-damage-response pathways control and promote replication dynamics in vertebrate cells. In particular, DNA damage pathways contribute to proper replication by regulating replication initiation, stabilizing transiently stalled forks, promoting replication restart and facilitating fork movement on difficult-to-replicate templates. If replication fork progression fails to be rescued, this may lead to DNA damage and genomic instability via nuclease processing of aberrant fork structures or incomplete sister chromatid separation during mitosis.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide {\$}F{\_}1{\$} scores up to 10{\%} higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60{\%} less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

A radioimmuno-slot-blot assay was developed, using a primary monoclonal antibody, Tau-1, and a secondary antibody, antimouse 125I-immunoglobulin G. To assay the abnormally phosphorylated tau, the blots were treated with alkaline phosphatase before immunolabeling. The levels of total tau were about eightfold higher in AD (7.3 +/- 2.7 ng/micrograms of protein) than in control cases (0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/micrograms), and this increase was in the form of the abnormally phosphorylated protein. These studies indicate that the abnormal phosphorylation--not a decrease in the level of tau--is a likely cause of neurofibrillary degeneration in AD.},

abstract = {Antidepressants targeting Na(+)/Cl(-)-coupled neurotransmitter uptake define a key therapeutic strategy to treat clinical depression and neuropathic pain. However, identifying the molecular interactions that underlie the pharmacological activity of these transport inhibitors, and thus the mechanism by which the inhibitors lead to increased synaptic neurotransmitter levels, has proven elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter at 3.0 {\AA} resolution bound to the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline. The transporter is locked in an outward-open conformation with nortriptyline wedged between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6 and 8, blocking the transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing conformation. Although the overall structure of the dopamine transporter is similar to that of its prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix 12 halfway across the membrane bilayer, a latch-like carboxy-terminal helix that caps the cytoplasmic gate, and a cholesterol molecule wedged within a groove formed by transmembrane helices 1a, 5 and 7. Taken together, the dopamine transporter structure reveals the molecular basis for antidepressant action on sodium-coupled neurotransmitter symporters and elucidates critical elements of eukaryotic transporter structure and modulation by lipids, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanism and regulation of neurotransmitter uptake at chemical synapses.},

However how good an algorithm is, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on real-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights potentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying communities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art algorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and algorithms' computing time. Based on simple network properties and the aforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most adequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these rules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given macroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we provide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in most circumstances based on observable properties of the network under consideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable indicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms. Finally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the algorithm's predicting power and the effective computing time.},

abstract = {Although electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis has become an important tool for structural biology of large and flexible macro-molecular assemblies, the technique has not yet reached its full potential. Besides fundamental limits imposed by radiation damage, poor detectors and beam-induced sample movement have been shown to degrade attainable resolutions. A new generation of direct electron detectors may ameliorate both effects. Apart from exhibiting improved signal-to-noise performance, these cameras are also fast enough to follow particle movements during electron irradiation. Here, we assess the potentials of this technology for cryo-EM structure determination. Using a newly developed statistical movie processing approach to compensate for beam-induced movement, we show that ribosome reconstructions with unprecedented resolutions may be calculated from almost two orders of magnitude fewer particles than used previously. Therefore, this methodology may expand the scope of high-resolution cryo-EM to a broad range of biological specimens.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00461.001.},

abstract = {In recent years views of eukaryotic gene expression have been transformed by the finding that enormous diversity can be generated at the RNA level. Advances in technologies for characterizing RNA populations are revealing increasingly complete descriptions of RNA regulation and complexity; for example, through alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation and RNA editing. New biochemical strategies to map protein-RNA interactions in vivo are yielding transcriptome-wide insights into mechanisms of RNA processing. These advances, combined with bioinformatics and genetic validation, are leading to the generation of functional RNA maps that reveal the rules underlying RNA regulation and networks of biologically coherent transcripts. Together these are providing new insights into molecular cell biology and disease.},

@article{Myers1995,
abstract = {The fragment assembly problem is that of reconstructing a DNA sequence from a collection of randomly sampled fragments. Traditionally, the objective of this problem has been to produce the shortest string that contains all the fragments as substrings, but in the case of repetitive target sequences this objective produces answers that are overcompressed. In this paper, the problem is reformulated as one of finding a maximum-likelihood reconstruction with respect to the two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, and it is argued that this is a better formulation of the problem. Next the fragment assembly problem is recast in graph-theoretic terms as one of finding a noncyclic subgraph with certain properties and the objectives of being shortest or maximally likely are also recast in this framework. Finally, a series of graph reduction transformations are given that dramatically reduce the size of the graph to be explored in practical instances of the problem. This reduction is very important as the underlying problems are NP-hard. In practice, the transformed problems are so small that simple branch-and-bound algorithms successfully solve them, thus permitting auxiliary experimental information to be taken into account in the form of overlap, orientation, and distance constraints. {\textcopyright} 1995, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Upon the discovery that chemotherapeutics could target these cell death pathways in a manner that was not mutually exclusive, new discoveries about the interrelationship between these two pathways are emerging. Key proteins originally thought to be "autophagy-related proteins" are now found to be involved in either inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. Similarly, apoptosis inhibiting proteins can also block autophagy-associated cell death. One example is the complex formed by the autophagy protein, Beclin 1, and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which leads to inhibition of autophagy-associated cell death. Researchers have been investigating additional mechanisms that form/disrupt this complex in order to better design chemotherapeutics. This review will highlight the role Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 play in cancer development and drug resistance, as well as the role the Bcl-2:Beclin 1 complex in the switch between autophagy and apoptosis.},

Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli species represents one of the best-studied model organisms, but also encompasses a variety of commensal and pathogenic strains that diversify by high rates of genetic change. We uniformly (re-) annotated the genomes of 20 commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains and one strain of E. fergusonii (the closest E. coli related species), including seven that we sequenced to completion. Within the ∼18,000 families of orthologous genes, we found ∼2,000 common to all strains. Although recombination rates are much higher than mutation rates, we show, both theoretically and using phylogenetic inference, that this does not obscure the phylogenetic signal, which places the B2 phylogenetic group and one group D strain at the basal position. Based on this phylogeny, we inferred past evolutionary events of gain and loss of genes, identifying functional classes under opposite selection pressures. We found an important adaptive role for metabolism diversification within group B2 and Shigella strains, but identified few or no extraintestinal virulence-specific genes, which could render difficult the development of a vaccine against extraintestinal infections. Genome flux in E. coli is confined to a small number of conserved positions in the chromosome, which most often are not associated with integrases or tRNA genes. Core genes flanking some of these regions show higher rates of recombination, suggesting that a gene, once acquired by a strain, spreads within the species by homologous recombination at the flanking genes. Finally, the genome's long-scale structure of recombination indicates lower recombination rates, but not higher mutation rates, at the terminus of replication. The ensuing effect of background selection and biased gene conversion may thus explain why this region is A+T-rich and shows high sequence divergence but low sequence polymorphism. Overall, despite a very high gene flow, genes co-exist in an organised genome. {\textcopyright} 2009 Touchon et al.},

abstract = {Plastic pollution in the ocean is a global concern; concentrations reach 580,000 pieces per km2 and production is increasing exponentially. Although a large number of empirical studies provide emerging evidence of impacts to wildlife, there has been little systematic assessment of risk. We performed a spatial risk analysis using predicted debris distributions and ranges for 186 seabird species to model debris exposure. We adjusted the model using published data on plastic ingestion by seabirds. Eighty of 135 (59{\%}) species with studies reported in the literature between 1962 and 2012 had ingested plastic, and, within those studies, on average 29{\%} of individuals had plastic in their gut. Standardizing the data for time and species, we estimate the ingestion rate would reach 90{\%} of individuals if these studies were conducted today. Using these results from the literature, we tuned our risk model and were able to capture 71{\%} of the variation in plastic ingestion based on a model including exposure, time, study method, and body size. We used this tuned model to predict risk across seabird species at the global scale. The highest area of expected impact occurs at the Southern Ocean boundary in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, which contrasts with previous work identifying this area as having low anthropogenic pressures and concentrations of marine debris. We predict that plastics ingestion is increasing in seabirds, that it will reach 99{\%} of all species by 2050, and that effective waste management can reduce this threat.},

@article{Franks2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most anesthetics, particularly intravenous agents such as propofol and etomidate, enhance the actions of the neurotransmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA type A receptor. However, there is no agreement as where anesthetics bind to the receptor. A novel approach would be to identify regions on the receptor that are state-dependent, which would account for the ability of anesthetics to affect channel opening by binding differentially to the open and closed states.

METHODS: The open and closed structures of the GABA type A receptor homologues Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel and glutamate-gated chloride channel were compared, and regions in the channels that move on channel opening and closing were identified. Docking calculations were performed to investigate possible binding of propofol to the GABA type A $\beta$3 homomer in this region.

RESULTS: A comparison between the open and closed states of the Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel and glutamate-gated chloride channel channels identified a region at the top of transmembrane domains 2 and 3 that shows maximum movement when the channels transition between the open and closed states. Docking of propofol into the GABA type A $\beta$3 homomer identified two putative binding cavities in this same region, one with a high affinity and one with a lower affinity. Both cavities were adjacent to a histidine residue that has been photolabeled by a propofol analog, and both sites would be disrupted on channel closing.

CONCLUSIONS: These calculations support the conclusion of a recent photolabeling study that propofol acts at a site at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains, close to the top of transmembrane domain 2.},

abstract = {The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is mobilized by the protein kinase ATM, which phosphorylates key players in the DNA damage response (DDR) network. A major question is how ATM controls DSB repair. Optimal repair requires chromatin relaxation at damaged sites. Chromatin reorganization is coupled to dynamic alterations in histone posttranslational modifications. Here, we show that in human cells, DSBs induce monoubiquitylation of histone H2B, a modification that is associated in undamaged cells with transcription elongation. We find that this process relies on recruitment to DSB sites and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the responsible E3 ubiquitin ligase: the RNF20-RNF40 heterodimer. H2B monoubiquitylation is required for timely recruitment of players in the two major DSB repair pathways-nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair-and optimal repair via both pathways. Our data and previous data suggest a two-stage model for chromatin decondensation that facilitates DSB repair.},

The pore is shaped by an inner ring of 5 alpha-helices, which curve radially to create a tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha-helices, which coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

abstract = {Single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) is a technique for determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from projection images of molecular complexes preserved in their "native," noncrystalline state. Recently, atomic or near-atomic resolution structures of several viruses and protein assemblies have been determined by single-particle cryoEM, allowing ab initio atomic model building by following the amino acid side chains or nucleic acid bases identifiable in their cryoEM density maps. In particular, these cryoEM structures have revealed extended arms contributing to molecular interactions that are otherwise not resolved by the conventional structural method of X-ray crystallography at similar resolutions. High-resolution cryoEM requires careful consideration of a number of factors, including proper sample preparation to ensure structural homogeneity, optimal configuration of electron imaging conditions to record high-resolution cryoEM images, accurate determination of image parameters to correct image distortions, efficient refinement and computation to reconstruct a 3D density map, and finally appropriate choice of modeling tools to construct atomic models for functional interpretation. This progress illustrates the power of cryoEM and ushers it into the arsenal of structural biology, alongside conventional techniques of X-ray crystallography and NMR, as a major tool (and sometimes the preferred one) for the studies of molecular interactions in supramolecular assemblies or machines.},

The Kindlin family is hallmarked by a FERM domain comprised of F1, F2, and F3 subdomains together with an N-terminal F0 domain and a pleckstrin homology domain inserted in the F2 domain. Recombinant Kindlin-3 was cloned, expressed, and purified, and its domain organization was studied by x-ray scattering and other techniques to reveal an extended conformation. This unusual elongated structure is similar to that found in the paralogue Talin head domain. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that Kindlin-3 forms a ternary complex with the Talin and $\beta$-integrin cytoplasmic tails. NMR showed that Kindlin-3 specifically recognizes the membrane-distal tail NPXY motif in both the $\beta$(1A) and $\beta$(1D) isoforms, although the interaction is stronger with $\beta$(1A). An upstream Ser/Thr cluster in the tails also plays a critical role. Overall these data support current biological, clinical, and mutational data on Kindlin-3/$\beta$-tail binding and provide novel insights into the overall conformation and interactions of Kindlin-3.},

abstract = {Nuclease colicins bind their target receptor in the outer membrane of sensitive cells in the form of a high affinity complex with their cognate immunity proteins. Upon cell entry the immunity protein is lost from the complex by means that are poorly understood. We have developed a sensitive fluorescence assay that has enabled us to study the molecular requirements for immunity protein release. Nuclease colicins use members of the tol operon for their translocation across the outer membrane. We have demonstrated that the amino-terminal 80 residues of the colicin E9 molecule, which is the region that interacts with TolB, are essential for immunity protein release. Using tol deletion strains we analyzed the cellular components necessary for immunity protein release and found that in addition to a requirement for tolB, the tolA deletion strain was most affected. Complementation studies showed that the mutation H22A, within the transmembrane segment of TolA, abolishes immunity protein release. Investigation of the energy requirements demonstrated that the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane is critical. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time a clear energy requirement for the uptake of a nuclease colicin complex and suggest that energy transduced from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane by TolA could be the driving force for immunity protein release and concomitant translocation of the nuclease domain.},

abstract = {This work presents a new perspective on characterizing the similarity between elements of a database or, more generally, nodes of a weighted and undirected graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the "length" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the "Fiedler vector," widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called "statistical relational learning" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database},

Past work has concentrated on average damage caused by random node removal, with little attention to the shape of the damage distribution. In this work, we use fission yeast co-expression networks before and after exposure to stress to model the effect of stress on mutational robustness. We find that exposure to stress decreases the average damage from node removal, suggesting stress induces greater tolerance to loss of function mutations. The shape of the damage distribution is also changed upon stress, with a greater incidence of extreme damage after exposure to stress. We demonstrate that the change in shape of the damage distribution can have considerable functional consequences, highlighting the need to consider the damage distribution in addition to average behaviour.},

Many software packages have been developed for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatment groups based on RNA-Seq data. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to approach an optimal study design and choice of suitable software for the analysis. In this comparative study we evaluate the performance of three of the most frequently used software tools: Cufflinks-Cuffdiff2, DESeq and edgeR. A number of important parameters of RNA-Seq technology were taken into consideration, including the number of replicates, sequencing depth, and balanced vs. unbalanced sequencing depth within and between groups. We benchmarked results relative to sets of DEGs identified through either quantitative RT-PCR or microarray. We observed that edgeR performs slightly better than DESeq and Cuffdiff2 in terms of the ability to uncover true positives. Overall, DESeq or taking the intersection of DEGs from two or more tools is recommended if the number of false positives is a major concern in the study. In other circumstances, edgeR is slightly preferable for differential expression analysis at the expense of potentially introducing more false positives.},

Here we show that NKT cells recognized diacylglycerol-containing glycolipids from Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and group B Streptococcus, which causes neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Furthermore, CD1d-dependent responses by NKT cells were required for activation and host protection. The glycolipid response was dependent on vaccenic acid, which is present in low concentrations in mammalian cells. Our results show how microbial lipids position the sugar for recognition by the invariant TCR and, most notably, extend the range of microbes recognized by this conserved TCR to several clinically important bacteria.},

It has been demonstrated that telomere shortening has been associated with cognitive impairment, amyloid pathology and hyper-phosphorylation of tau in AD and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD via the mechanism of oxidative stress and inflammation. However, it seems that there is no relationship between telomere shortening and AD. Therefore, it is essential for further clarification of telomere-related pathogenesis in AD.},

@article{Dewey2014,
abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly applied in clinical medicine and is expected to uncover clinically significant findings regardless of sequencing indication.

OBJECTIVES: To examine coverage and concordance of clinically relevant genetic variation provided by WGS technologies; to quantitate inherited disease risk and pharmacogenomic findings in WGS data and resources required for their discovery and interpretation; and to evaluate clinical action prompted by WGS findings.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An exploratory study of 12 adult participants recruited at Stanford University Medical Center who underwent WGS between November 2011 and March 2012. A multidisciplinary team reviewed all potentially reportable genetic findings. Five physicians proposed initial clinical follow-up based on the genetic findings.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genome coverage and sequencing platform concordance in different categories of genetic disease risk, person-hours spent curating candidate disease-risk variants, interpretation agreement between trained curators and disease genetics databases, burden of inherited disease risk and pharmacogenomic findings, and burden and interrater agreement of proposed clinical follow-up.

RESULTS: Depending on sequencing platform, 10{\%} to 19{\%} of inherited disease genes were not covered to accepted standards for single nucleotide variant discovery. Genotype concordance was high for previously described single nucleotide genetic variants (99{\%}-100{\%}) but low for small insertion/deletion variants (53{\%}-59{\%}). Curation of 90 to 127 genetic variants in each participant required a median of 54 minutes (range, 5-223 minutes) per genetic variant, resulted in moderate classification agreement between professionals (Gross $\kappa$, 0.52; 95{\%} CI, 0.40-0.64), and reclassified 69{\%} of genetic variants cataloged as disease causing in mutation databases to variants of uncertain or lesser significance. Two to 6 personal disease-risk findings were discovered in each participant, including 1 frameshift deletion in the BRCA1 gene implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Physician review of sequencing findings prompted consideration of a median of 1 to 3 initial diagnostic tests and referrals per participant, with fair interrater agreement about the suitability of WGS findings for clinical follow-up (Fleiss $\kappa$, 0.24; P {\textless} 001).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this exploratory study of 12 volunteer adults, the use of WGS was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of detection of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable findings. In certain cases, WGS will identify clinically actionable genetic variants warranting early medical intervention. These issues should be considered when determining the role of WGS in clinical medicine.},

abstract = {Tp53 is the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in human cancers. In addition to the loss of tumour-suppression function, some missense mutants gain novel oncogenic activities. To elucidate the nature of the gain of function, we introduced the most common p53 cancer mutations (R248W and R273H) independently into the humanized p53 knock-in (HUPKI) allele in mice. Tumour-suppressor functions of p53 are abolished in p53-mutant mice. Several lines of evidence further indicate gain-of-function of p53 mutants in promoting tumorigenesis. p53(R248W) mice rapidly succumb to certain types of cancers not commonly observed in p53(-/-) mice. Interchromosomal translocations, a type of genetic instability rarely observed in p53(-/-) cells, are readily detectable in p53-mutant pre-tumor thymocytes. Although normal in p53(-/-) mouse cells, the G(2)-M checkpoint is impaired in p53-mutant cells after DNA damage. These acquired oncogenic properties of mutant p53 could be explained by the findings that these p53 mutants interact with the nuclease Mre11 and suppress the binding of the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 (MRN) complex to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), leading to impaired Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation. Therefore, p53 gain-of-function mutants promote tumorigenesis by a novel mechanism involving active disruption of critical DNA damage-response pathways.},

abstract = {Our body habitat-associated microbial communities are of intense research interest because of their influence on human health. Because many studies of the microbiota are based on the same bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene target, they can, in principle, be compared to determine the relative importance of different disease/physiologic/developmental states. However, differences in experimental protocols used may produce variation that outweighs biological differences. By comparing 16S rRNA gene sequences generated from diverse studies of the human microbiota using the QIIME database, we found that variation in composition of the microbiota across different body sites was consistently larger than technical variability across studies. However, samples from different studies of the Western adult fecal microbiota generally clustered by study, and the 16S rRNA target region, DNA extraction technique, and sequencing platform produced systematic biases in observed diversity that could obscure biologically meaningful compositional differences. In contrast, systematic compositional differences in the fecal microbiota that occurred with age and between Western and more agrarian cultures were great enough to outweigh technical variation. Furthermore, individuals with ileal Crohn's disease and in their third trimester of pregnancy often resembled infants from different studies more than controls from the same study, indicating parallel compositional attributes of these distinct developmental/physiological/disease states. Together, these results show that cross-study comparisons of human microbiota are valuable when the studied parameter has a large effect size, but studies of more subtle effects on the human microbiota require carefully selected control populations and standardized protocols. {\textcopyright} 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Motivation: A sizeable fraction of eukaryotic proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which act in unfolded states or by undergoing transitions between structured and unstructured conformations. Over time, sequence-based classifiers of IDRs have become fairly accurate and currently a major challenge is linking IDRs to their biological roles from the molecular to the systems level.Results: We describe DISOPRED3, which extends its predecessor with new modules to predict IDRs and protein-binding sites within them. Based on recent CASP evaluation results, DISOPRED3 can be regarded as state of the art in the identification of IDRs, and our self-assessment shows that it significantly improves over DISOPRED2 because its predictions are more specific across the whole board and more sensitive to IDRs longer than 20 amino acids. Predicted IDRs are annotated as protein binding through a novel SVM based classifier, which uses profile data and additional sequence-derived features. Based on benchmarking experiments with full cross-validation, we show that this predictor generates precise assignments of disordered protein binding regions and that it compares well with other publicly available tools.Availability and implementation: http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopredContact: d.t.jones@ucl.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {One of the major difficulties in mining low abundance biomarkers from serum or plasma is due to the fact that a small number of proteins such as albumin, $\alpha$2-macroglobulin, transferrin, and immunoglobulins, may represent as much as 80{\%} of the total serum protein. The large quantity of these proteins makes it difficult to identify low abundance proteins in serum using traditional 2-dimensional electrophoresis. We recently used a combination of multidimensional liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-quadrupole-time of flight and Ion Trap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify protein markers in sera of Alzheimer's disease (AD), insulin resistance/type-2 diabetes (IR/ D2), and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. We identified 8 proteins that exhibit higher levels in control sera and 36 proteins that exhibit higher levels in disease sera. For example, haptoglobin and hemoglobin are elevated in sera of AD, IR/D2, and CHF patients. The levels of several other proteins including fibrinogen and its fragments, alpha 2-macroglobulin, transthyretin, pro-platelet basic protein, protease inhibitors clade A and C, as well as proteins involved in the classical complement pathway such as complement C3, C4, and C1 inhibitor, were found to differ between IR/D2 and control sera. The sera levels of proteins, such as the 10 kDa subunit of vitronectin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein B100, fragment of factor H, and histidine-rich glycoprotein were observed to be different between AD and controls. The differences observed in these biomarker candidates were confirmed by Western blot and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biological meaning of the proteomic changes in the disease states and the potential use of these changes as diagnostic tools or for therapeutic intervention will be discussed.},

abstract = {Pathogenic deviations (PDs) in humans are disease-causing missense mutations. However, in some cases, these disease-associated residues occur as the wild-type residues in functionally equivalent proteins in other species and these cases are termed 'compensated pathogenic deviations' (CPDs). The lack of pathogenicity in a non-human protein is presumed to be explained in most cases by the presence of compensatory mutations, most commonly within the same protein. Identification of structural features of CPDs and detection of specific compensatory events will help us to understand traversal along fitness landscape valleys in protein evolution. We divided mutations listed in the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database into PD and CPD data sets and performed two independent analyses: (i) We searched for potential compensatory mutations spatially close to the CPDs and, (ii) using our SAAPdb database, we examined likely structural effects to try to explain why mutations are pathogenic, comparing PDs and CPDs. Our data sets were obtained from a set of 245 human proteins of known structure and contained a total of 2328 mutations of which 453 (from 85 structures) were seen to be compensated in at least one functionally equivalent protein in another (non-human) species. Structural analysis results confirm previous findings that CPDs are, on average, 'milder' in their likely structural effects than uncompensated PDs and tend to be on the protein surface. We also showed that the residues surrounding the CPD residue in the folded protein are more often mutated than the residues surrounding an uncompensated mutation, supporting the hypothesis that compensation is largely a result of structurally local mutations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse neurotransmitter uptake from the synaptic cleft into the cytoplasm of glial cells and neurons. Their mechanism of action involves transitions between extracellular (outward)-facing and intracellular (inward)-facing conformations, whereby substrate binding sites become accessible to either side of the membrane. This process has been proposed to entail transmembrane movements of three discrete transport domains within a trimeric scaffold. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging, we have directly observed large-scale transport domain movements in a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters. We find that individual transport domains alternate between periods of quiescence and periods of rapid transitions, reminiscent of bursting patterns first recorded in single ion channels using patch-clamp methods. We propose that the switch to the dynamic mode in glutamate transporters is due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold, which precedes domain movements across the bilayer. This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining in the transport cycle.},

Yet, developers of automated computational modeling methods clearly benefit from more frequent evaluations based on larger sets of data. The “Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn (CAMEO)” platform complements the CASP experiment by conducting fully automated blind prediction assessments based on the weekly pre-release of sequences of those structures, which are going to be published in the next release of the PDB Protein Data Bank. CAMEO publishes weekly benchmarking results based on models collected during a 4-day prediction window, on average assessing ca. 100 targets during a time frame of 5 weeks. CAMEO benchmarking data is generated consistently for all participating methods at the same point in time, enabling developers to benchmark and cross-validate their method's performance, and directly refer to the benchmarking results in publications. In order to facilitate server development and promote shorter release cycles, CAMEO sends weekly email with submission statistics and low performance warnings. Many participants of CASP have successfully employed CAMEO when preparing their methods for upcoming community experiments. CAMEO offers a variety of scores to allow benchmarking diverse aspects of structure prediction methods. By introducing new scoring schemes, CAMEO facilitates new development in areas of active research, for example, modeling quaternary structure, complexes, or ligand binding sites.},

Because nsSNPs can affect protein function, they are believed to have the largest impact on human health compared with SNPs in other regions of the genome. Therefore, it is important to distinguish those nsSNPs that affect protein function from those that are functionally neutral. Here we provide an overview of amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods, which use sequence and/or structure to predict the effect of an AAS on protein function. Most methods predict approximately 25-30{\%} of human nsSNPs to negatively affect protein function, and such nsSNPs tend to be rare in the population. We discuss the utility of AAS prediction methods for Mendelian and complex diseases as well as their broader applications for understanding protein function},

abstract = {Interactions of lipids are central to the folding and stability of membrane proteins. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations have been used to reveal the mechanisms of self-assembly of protein/membrane and protein/detergent complexes for representatives of two classes of membrane protein, namely, glycophorin (a simple alpha-helical bundle) and OmpA (a beta-barrel). The accuracy of the coarse-grained simulations is established via comparison with the equivalent atomistic simulations of self-assembly of protein/detergent micelles. The simulation of OmpA/bilayer self-assembly reveals how a folded outer membrane protein can be inserted in a bilayer. The glycophorin/bilayer simulation supports the two-state model of membrane folding, in which transmembrane helix insertion precedes dimer self-assembly within a bilayer. The simulations also suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the glycophorin helix monomer and dimer within a bilayer. The simulated glycophorin helix dimer is remarkably close in structure to that revealed by NMR. Thus, coarse-grained methods may help to define mechanisms of membrane protein (re)folding and will prove suitable for simulation of larger scale dynamic rearrangements of biological membranes.},

Recent applications have provided in situ structural data at resolutions of 2-4. nm on samples including polysomes, nuclear pores, vesicle coats, and viral surface proteins.

A large internal hydrophilic cavity open to the cytoplasmic side represents the inward-facing conformation of the transporter. The structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, reveals the sugar-binding site in the cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation are identified.

The ability to refine the functional classification of domains within these superfamilies is necessary for better understanding the evolution of functions and to guide function prediction of new relatives. To achieve this, a suitable starting point is the detailed analysis of functional divisions and mechanisms of functional divergence in a single superfamily. Here, we present such a detailed analysis in the superfamily of HUP domains. A biologically meaningful functional classification of HUP domains is obtained manually. Mechanisms of function diversification are investigated in detail using this classification. We observe that structural motifs play an important role in shaping broad functional divergence, whereas residue-level changes shape diversity at a more specific level. In parallel we examine the ability of an automated protocol to capture the biologically meaningful classification, with a view to automatically extending this classification in the future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite decades of speculation, the proton pumping mechanism of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is unknown and continues to be controversial. Recent descriptions of the architecture of the hydrophobic region of complex I have resolved one vital issue: this region appears to have multiple proton transporters that are mechanically interlinked. Thus, transduction of conformational changes to drive the transmembrane transporters linked by a "connecting rod" during the reduction of ubiquinone (Q) can account for two or three of the four protons pumped per NADH oxidized. The remaining proton(s) must be pumped by direct coupling at the Q-binding site. Here, we present a mixed model based on a crucial constraint: the strong dependence on the pH gradient across the membrane ($\Delta$pH) of superoxide generation at the Q-binding site of complex I. This model combines direct and indirect coupling mechanisms to account for the pumping of the four protons. It explains the observed properties of the semiquinone in the Q-binding site, the rapid superoxide production from this site during reverse electron transport, its low superoxide production during forward electron transport except in the presence of inhibitory Q-analogs and high protonmotive force, and the strong dependence of both modes of superoxide production on $\Delta$pH.},

In this study, we developed a homogenous preparation strategy by site-specific conjugation of the anticancer drug with antibody fragment. The model drug doxorubicin (DOX) was coupled to the Fab' fragment of anti-CD20 IgG at its permissive sites through a heterotelechelic PEG linker, generating an antibody fragment-drug conjugate (AFDC). Anti-CD20 IgG was digested and reduced specifically with $\beta$-mercaptoethylamine to generate Fab' fragment with two free mercapto groups in its hinge region. Meanwhile, DOX was conjugated with $\alpha$-succinimidylsuccinate $\omega$-maleimide polyethylene glycol (NHS-PEG-MAL) to form MAL-PEG-DOX, which was subsequently linked to the free mercapto containing Fab' fragment to form a Fab'-PEG-DOX conjugate. The dual site-specific bioconjugation was achieved through the combination of highly selective reduction of IgG and the introduction of heterotelechelic PEG linker. The resulting AFDC provides an utterly homogeneous product, with a definite ratio of one fragment with two drugs. Laser confocal microscopy and cell ELISA revealed that the AFDC could accumulate in the antigen-positive Daudi tumor cell. In addition, the Fab'-PEG-DOX retained appreciable targeting ability and improved anti-tumor activity, demonstrating excellent therapeutic effect on lymphoma mice model for better cure rate and significantly reduced side effects.},

The presence of classical absorption lowers the threshold irradiance for the detection of sample-specific ions and increases the ratio of molecular-to-fragment ions. These observations promise to be of considerable value for future practical application of laser desorption mass spectrometry of organics. The enhanced ion yield of nonabsorbing molecules in an absorbing matrix is presented as an example. Two models for the wavelength influence are discussed, one assuming a predominantly resonant one-photon energy transfer for highly absorbing samples and the other postulating an increased ion yield via excited states. {\textcopyright} 1985, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {Expression profiling, ChiP-CHIP and phenotypic analysis were used to investigate the functional relationships of class III NAD(+)-dependent HDACs (Sirtuins) in fission yeast. We detected significant histone acetylation increases in Sirtuin mutants at their specific genomic binding targets and were thus able to identify an in vivo substrate preference for each Sirtuin. At heterochromatic loci, we demonstrate that although Hst2 is mainly cytoplasmic, a nuclear pool of Hst2 colocalizes with the other Sirtuins at silent regions (cen, mat, tel, rDNA), and that like the other Sirtuins, Hst2 is required for rDNA and centromeric silencing. Interestingly we found specific functions for the fission yeast Sirtuins Hst2 and Hst4 in gene regulation. Hst2 directly represses genes involved in transport and membrane function, whereas Hst4 represses amino-acid biosynthesis genes and Tf2 retrotransposons. A specific role for Hst4 in Tf2 5' mRNA processing was revealed. Thus, Sirtuins share functions at many genomic targets, but Hst2 and Hst4 have also evolved unique functions in gene regulation.},

Members of the formate/nitrite transport protein family function to shuttle substrate across the cytoplasmic membrane. In bacterial pathogens, the nitrite transport protein is involved in protecting bacteria from peroxynitrite released by host macrophages. We have determined the 2.13-A structure of the formate channel FocA from Vibrio cholerae, which reveals a pentamer in which each monomer possesses its own substrate translocation pore. Unexpectedly, the fold of the FocA monomer resembles that found in water and glycerol channels. The selectivity filter in FocA consists of a cytoplasmic slit and a central constriction ring. A 2.5-A high-formate structure shows two formate ions bound to the cytoplasmic slit via both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, providing a structural basis for the substrate selectivity of the channel.},

The ability to extract information from protein sequences and to predict the effects of mutations is extremely valuable in many domains of biology and medicine. However the mapping between protein sequence and function is complex and poorly understood. Here we present an embedding of natural protein sequences using a Vari-ational Auto-Encoder and use it to predict how mutations affect protein function. We use this unsupervised approach to cluster natural variants and learn interactions between sets of positions within a protein. This approach generally performs better than baseline methods that consider no interactions within sequences, and in some cases better than the state-of-the-art approaches that use the inverse-Potts model. This generative model can be used to computationally guide exploration of protein sequence space and to better inform rational and automatic protein design.},

abstract = {Cellular membranes are composed of hundreds of different lipids, ion channels, receptors and scaffolding complexes that act as signalling and trafficking platforms for processes fundamental to life. Cellular signalling and membrane trafficking are often regulated by peripheral proteins, which reversibly interact with lipid molecules in highly regulated spatial and temporal fashions. In most cases, one or more modular lipid-binding domain(s) mediate recruitment of peripheral proteins to specific cellular membranes. These domains, of which more than 10 have been identified since 1989, harbour structurally selective lipid-binding sites. Traditional in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated how these domains coordinate their cognate lipids and thus how the parent proteins associate with membranes. Cellular activities of peripheral proteins and subsequent physiological processes depend upon lipid binding affinities and selectivity. Thus, the development of novel sensitive and quantitative tools is essential in furthering our understanding of the function and regulation of these proteins. As this field expands into new areas such as computational biology, cellular lipid mapping, single molecule imaging, and lipidomics, there is an urgent need to integrate technologies to detail the molecular architecture and mechanisms of lipid signalling. This review surveys emerging cellular and in vitro approaches for studying protein-lipid interactions and provides perspective on how integration of methodologies directs the future development of the field.},

abstract = {We present CATHEDRAL, an iterative protocol for determining the location of previously observed protein folds in novel multidomain protein structures. CATHEDRAL builds on the features of a fast secondary-structure-based method (using graph theory) to locate known folds within a multidomain context and a residue-based, double-dynamic programming algorithm, which is used to align members of the target fold groups against the query protein structure to identify the closest relative and assign domain boundaries. To increase the fidelity of the assignments, a support vector machine is used to provide an optimal scoring scheme. Once a domain is verified, it is excised, and the search protocol is repeated in an iterative fashion until all recognisable domains have been identified. We have performed an initial benchmark of CATHEDRAL against other publicly available structure comparison methods using a consensus dataset of domains derived from the CATH and SCOP domain classifications. CATHEDRAL shows superior performance in fold recognition and alignment accuracy when compared with many equivalent methods. If a novel multidomain structure contains a known fold, CATHEDRAL will locate it in 90{\%} of cases, with {\textless}1{\%} false positives. For nearly 80{\%} of assigned domains in a manually validated test set, the boundaries were correctly delineated within a tolerance of ten residues. For the remaining cases, previously classified domains were very remotely related to the query chain so that embellishments to the core of the fold caused significant differences in domain sizes and manual refinement of the boundaries was necessary. To put this performance in context, a well-established sequence method based on hidden Markov models was only able to detect 65{\%} of domains, with 33{\%} of the subsequent boundaries assigned within ten residues. Since, on average, 50{\%} of newly determined protein structures contain more than one domain unit, and typically 90{\%} or more of these domains are already classified in CATH, CATHEDRAL will considerably facilitate the automation of protein structure classification. {\textcopyright} 2007 Redfern et al.},

Using a subtractive hybridization approach, we identified a gene, named WAF1, whose induction was associated with wild-type but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human brain tumor cell line. The WAF1 gene was localized to chromosome 6p21.2, and its sequence, structure, and activation by p53 was conserved in rodents. Introduction of WAF1 cDNA suppressed the growth of human brain, lung, and colon tumor cells in culture. Using a yeast enhancer trap, a p53-binding site was identified 2.4 kb upstream of WAF1 coding sequences. The WAF1 promoter, including this p53-binding site, conferred p53-dependent inducibility upon a heterologous reporter gene. These studies define a gene whose expression is directly induced by p53 and that could be an important mediator of p53-dependent tumor growth suppression.},

Since the adoption of modularity as a measure of network topological properties, several methodologies for the discovery of community structure based on modularity maximisation have been developed. However, satisfactory partitions of large graphs with modest computational resources are particularly challenging due to the NP-hard nature of the related optimisation problem. Furthermore, it has been suggested that optimising the modularity metric can reach a resolution limit whereby the algorithm fails to detect smaller communities than a specific size in large networks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a novel solution approach to identify community structure in large complex networks and address resolution limitations in module detection. The proposed algorithm employs modularity to express network community structure and it is based on mixed integer optimisation models. The solution procedure is extended through an iterative procedure to diminish effects that tend to agglomerate smaller modules (resolution limitations).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive comparative analysis of methodologies for module detection based on modularity maximisation shows that our approach outperforms previously reported methods. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, we propose a strategy to handle resolution limitations in modularity maximisation.

Here we compared three DNA amplification methods to enrich viral DNA from three pristine limestone aquifer assemblages of the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory to evaluate potential bias created by the different amplification methods as determined by viral metagenomics. Linker amplification shotgun libraries resulted in lowest redundancy among the sequencing reads and showed the highest diversity, while multiple displacement amplification produced the highest number of contigs with the longest average contig size, suggesting a combination of these two methods is suitable for the successful enrichment of viral DNA from pristine groundwater samples. In total, we identified 27,173, 5,886 and 32,613 viral contigs from the three samples from which 11.92 to 18.65{\%} could be assigned to taxonomy using blast. Among these, members of the Caudovirales order were the most abundant group (52.20 to 69.12{\%}) dominated by Myoviridae and Siphoviridae.

abstract = {Proper functioning of complex phenotypes requires that multiple traits work together. Examination of relationships among traits within and between complex characters and how they interact to function as a whole organism is critical to advancing our understanding of evolutionary developmental plasticity. Phenotypic integration refers to the relationships among multiple characters of a complex phenotype, and their relationships with other functional units (modules) in an organism. In this review, I summarize a brief history of the concept of phenotypic integration in plant and animal biology. Following an introduction of concepts, including modularity, I use an empirical case-study approach to highlight recent advance in clarifying the developmental and genomic basis of integration. I end by highlighting some novel approaches to genomic and epigenetic perturbations that offer promise in further addressing the role of phenotypic integration in evolutionary diversification. In the age of the phenotype, studies that examine the genomic and developmental changes in relationships of traits across environments will shape the next chapter in our quest for understanding the evolution of complex characters. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {Ageing is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). One in ten individuals aged ≥65 years has AD and its prevalence continues to increase with increasing age. Few or no effective treatments are available for ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases, which tend to progress in an irreversible manner and are associated with large socioeconomic and personal costs. This Review discusses the pathogenesis of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and describes their associations with the nine biological hallmarks of ageing: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, deregulated nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion and altered intercellular communication. The central biological mechanisms of ageing and their potential as targets of novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases are also discussed, with potential therapies including NAD+ precursors, mitophagy inducers and inhibitors of cellular senescence.},

To understand the structural effects of missense mutations, we consider both classes under the term single amino acid polymorphisms (SAAPs) and we wish to map these to protein structure where their effects can be analyzed. Our initial aim therefore is to create a completely automatically maintained database of SAAPs mapped to individual residues in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) updated as new mutations or structures become available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present an integrated pipeline for the automated mapping of SAAP data from HGVbase to individual PDB residues. Achieving this in a completely automated and reliable manner is a complex task. Data extracted from HGVbase are mapped to EMBL entries to confirm whether the mutation occurs in an exon and, if so, where in the sequence it occurs.

abstract = {N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are Hebbian-like coincidence detectors, requiring binding of glycine and glutamate in combination with the relief of voltage-dependent magnesium block to open an ion conductive pore across the membrane bilayer. Despite the importance of the NMDA receptor in the development and function of the brain, a molecular structure of an intact receptor has remained elusive. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of the Xenopus laevis GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor with the allosteric inhibitor, Ro25-6981, partial agonists and the ion channel blocker, MK-801. Receptor subunits are arranged in a 1-2-1-2 fashion, demonstrating extensive interactions between the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. The transmembrane domains harbour a closed-blocked ion channel, a pyramidal central vestibule lined by residues implicated in binding ion channel blockers and magnesium, and a ∼twofold symmetric arrangement of ion channel pore loops. These structures provide new insights into the architecture, allosteric coupling and ion channel function of NMDA receptors.},

abstract = {Several inherited syndromes in humans are associated with cancer predisposition. The gene products defective in two of these disorders, BLM (a helicase defective in Bloom's syndrome) and FANC A-N (defective in Fanconi anaemia), associate in a multienzyme complex called BRAFT. How these proteins suppress tumorigenesis remains unclear, although both conditions are associated with chromosome instability. Here we show that the Fanconi anaemia proteins FANCD2 and FANCI specifically associate with common fragile site loci irrespective of whether the chromosome is broken. Unexpectedly, these loci are frequently interlinked through BLM-associated ultra-fine DNA bridges (UFBs) even as cells traverse mitosis. Similarly to fragile site expression, fragile site bridging is induced after partial inhibition of DNA replication. We propose that, after replication stress, sister chromatids are interlinked by replication intermediates primarily at genetic loci with intrinsic replication difficulties, such as fragile sites. In Bloom's syndrome cells, inefficient resolution of DNA linkages at fragile sites gives rise to increased numbers of anaphase UFBs and micronuclei containing fragile site DNA. Our data have general implications concerning the contribution of fragile site loci to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis.},

The structure of photosystem II has been reported at resolutions from 3.8 to 2.9 {\AA}. These resolutions have provided much information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors but are insufficient to reveal the detailed structure of the catalytic centre of water splitting. Here we report the crystal structure of photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 {\AA}. From our electron density map, we located all of the metal atoms of the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster, together with all of their ligands. We found that five oxygen atoms served as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms, and that four water molecules were bound to the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster; some of them may therefore serve as substrates for dioxygen formation. We identified more than 1,300 water molecules in each photosystem II monomer. Some of them formed extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. The determination of the high-resolution structure of photosystem II will allow us to analyse and understand its functions in great detail.},

abstract = {Antisense expression of a full length cDNA encoding plastid aldolase led to decreased expression of aldolase at the transcript and protein level in several 'antisense' potato transformants. To quantify the inhibition, activity was compared in corresponding leaves down a plant and in plants of different ages. Aldolase activity was decreased by 32-43{\%}, 56-71{\%}, 79-83{\%} and 91-97{\%} in A-70, A-3, A-51 and A-2. Separation on a Q-Sepharose-FF column showed the decrease was due to inhibition of plastid aldolase. The transformants showed a small increase of Rubisco activity, a small decrease of phosphoribulokinase activity, and larger but subproportional decreases of sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase and plastid fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity. Ambient photosynthesis was inhibited by 10{\%}, 40{\%}, 66{\%} and 85{\%} in A-70, A-3, A-51 and A-2. The transformants contained increased triose phosphates, and very low ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and glycerate-3-phosphate. Chlorophyll fluorescence indicated that photosystem II was more reduced and thylakoid energization was increased. Starch synthesis was decreased by 16{\%} and 36{\%} in A-70 and A-3, whereas sucrose synthesis was less strongly inhibited. Plant growth was not significantly altered in A-70, was decreased by 41{\%} in A-3, and was severely inhibited in plants with under 20{\%} of wild-type aldolase activity. Although plastid aldolase catalyses a readily reversible reaction, possesses no known regulatory properties, and would appear irrelevant for the control of metabolism and growth, small changes in its activity have marked consequences for photosynthesis, carbon partitioning and growth.},

abstract = {The innate immune system is comprised of a sophisticated network of recognition and effector molecules that act together to protect the host in the first minutes or hours of exposure to an infectious challenge. The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an evolutionary conserved circulating host defense protein that acts as a broad-spectrum recognition molecule against a wide variety of infectious agents. Target binding triggers the MBL pathway of complement activation. MBL can be considered conceptually as an 'ante-antibody' because it has a role in mammals during the lag period that is required to develop an antibody response against infectious agents. Additionally, there are MBL-like homologues in animals that lack adaptive immunity that activate a primitive complement system, and under these circumstances these MBL-like molecules play an analogous role to antibodies in higher animals. These molecules might be considered to be functional antecedents of antibodies. Recent work also indicates that MBL recognizes altered self-antigens, and as such MBL has a role that extends beyond a traditional role in first line host defense as it appears to play a role as a modulator of inflammation.},

Importantly, we show that rapid and transient transcriptional upregulation inherent to neuronal activation physiology creates U1 shortage relative to pre-mRNAs.

abstract = {Repair and integrity of DNA ends at breaks, replication forks and telomeres are essential for life; yet, paradoxically, these responses are, in many cases, controlled by a single protein complex, Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN). The MRN complex consists of dimers of each subunit and this heterohexamer controls key sensing, signaling, regulation, and effector responses to DNA double-strand breaks including ATM activation, homologous recombinational repair, microhomology-mediated end joining and, in some organisms, non-homologous end joining. We propose that this is possible because each MRN subunit can exist in three or more distinct states; thus, the trimer of MRN dimers can exist in a stunning 6(3) or 216 states, a number that can be expanded further when post-translational modifications are taken into account. MRN can therefore be considered as a molecular computer that effectively assesses optimal responses and pathway choice based upon its states as set by cell status and the nature of the DNA damage. This extreme multi-state concept demands a paradigm shift from striving to understand DNA damage responses in separate terms of signaling, checkpoint, and effector proteins: we must now endeavor to characterize conformational and assembly states of MRN and other DNA repair machines that couple, coordinate, and control biological outcomes. Addressing the emerging challenge of gaining a detailed molecular understanding of MRN and other multi-state dynamic DNA repair machines promises to provide opportunities to develop master keys for controlling cell biology with probable impacts on therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Motivation: The inference of genes that are truly associated with inherited human diseases from a set of candidates resulting from genetic linkage studies has been one of the most challenging tasks in human genetics. Although several computational approaches have been proposed to prioritize candidate genes relying on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, these methods can usually cover less than half of known human genes.Results: We propose to rely on the biological process domain of the gene ontology to construct a gene semantic similarity network and then use the network to infer disease genes. We show that the constructed network covers about 50{\%} more genes than a typical PPI network. By analyzing the gene semantic similarity network with the PPI network, we show that gene pairs tend to have higher semantic similarity scores if the corresponding proteins are closer to each other in the PPI network. By analyzing the gene semantic similarity network with a phenotype similarity network, we show that semantic similarity scores of genes associated with similar diseases are significantly different from those of genes selected at random, and that genes with higher semantic similarity scores tend to be associated with diseases with higher phenotype similarity scores. We further use the gene semantic similarity network with a random walk with restart model to infer disease genes. Through a series of large-scale leave-one-out cross-validation experiments, we show that the gene semantic similarity network can achieve not only higher coverage but also higher accuracy than the PPI network in the inference of disease genes.Contact: ruijiang@tsinghua.edu.cn . {\textcopyright} 2011 Jiang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

This gene was fused to the Escherichia coli $\beta$-galactosidase gene on the plasmid pBR322. Transformation of E. coli with the chimeric plasmid DNA led to the synthesis of a polypeptide including the sequence of amino acids corresponding to somatostatin. In vitro, active somatostatin was specifically cleaved from the large chimeric protein by treatment with cyanogen bromide. This represents the first synthesis of a functional polypeptide product from a gene of chemically synthesized origin.},

abstract = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50{\%}. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering - using filter/ test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative - is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

Comparison of this structure with the closed-state structure in complex with competitive antagonist ZK 200775 suggests conformational changes that occur during iGluR gating. Guided by the structures, we engineered disulfide cross-links to probe domain interactions that are important for iGluR gating events.

Proteomics, as a branch of biochemistry, has in recent years played a pivotal role in extending and developing the science of accurately identifying the biology and interactions of groups of proteins or proteomes. Proteomics has primarily used mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques for identifying proteins, although other techniques including affinity-based identifications still play significant roles. Here, we outline the basics of MS to understand how data are generated and parameters used to inform computational tools used in protein identification. We then outline a comprehensive analysis of the bioinformatics and computational methodologies used in protein identification in proteomics including discussing the most current communally acceptable metrics to validate any identification.},

abstract = {Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases. They mediate adaptive responses to a variety of stresses, including calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A synthetase 2 (refs 1, 2). Mice lacking both Sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions, but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins. Here we report that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During fasting, livers from mice lacking SIRT3 had higher levels of fatty-acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with decreased levels of fatty-acid oxidation, compared to livers from wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins shows that long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of SIRT3. LCAD is deacetylated in wild-type mice under fasted conditions and by SIRT3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of LCAD reduces its enzymatic activity. Mice lacking SIRT3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty-acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold exposure. These findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation and demonstrate that SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty-acid use during fasting.},

Phyre2 replaces Phyre, the original version of the server for which we previously published a paper in Nature Protocols. In this updated protocol, we describe Phyre2, which uses advanced remote homology detection methods to build 3D models, predict ligand binding sites and analyze the effect of amino acid variants (e.g., nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)) for a user's protein sequence. Users are guided through results by a simple interface at a level of detail they determine. This protocol will guide users from submitting a protein sequence to interpreting the secondary and tertiary structure of their models, their domain composition and model quality. A range of additional available tools is described to find a protein structure in a genome, to submit large number of sequences at once and to automatically run weekly searches for proteins that are difficult to model. The server is available at http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2. A typical structure prediction will be returned between 30 min and 2 h after submission.},

@article{Gogala2014,
abstract = {The biogenesis of secretory as well as transmembrane proteins requires the activity of the universally conserved protein-conducting channel (PCC), the Sec61 complex (SecY complex in bacteria). In eukaryotic cells the PCC is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where it can bind to translating ribosomes for co-translational protein transport. The Sec complex consists of three subunits (Sec61$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$) and provides an aqueous environment for the translocation of hydrophilic peptides as well as a lateral opening in the Sec61$\alpha$ subunit that has been proposed to act as a gate for the membrane partitioning of hydrophobic domains. A plug helix and a so-called pore ring are believed to seal the PCC against ion flow and are proposed to rearrange for accommodation of translocating peptides. Several crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures revealed different conformations of closed and partially open Sec61 and SecY complexes. However, in none of these samples has the translocation state been unambiguously defined biochemically. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosome-bound Sec61 complexes engaged in translocation or membrane insertion of nascent peptides. Our data show that a hydrophilic peptide can translocate through the Sec complex with an essentially closed lateral gate and an only slightly rearranged central channel. Membrane insertion of a hydrophobic domain seems to occur with the Sec complex opening the proposed lateral gate while rearranging the plug to maintain an ion permeability barrier. Taken together, we provide a structural model for the basic activities of the Sec61 complex as a protein-conducting channel.},

Although many sophisticated mice APP models exist, none recapitulates AD cellular and behavioral pathology. The morphological resemblance to AD amyloidosis is impressive, but fundamental biophysical and biochemical properties of the APP/A?? produced in Tg mice differ substantially from those of humans. The greater resilience of Tg mice in the presence of substantial A?? burdens suggests that levels and forms deleterious to human neurons are not as noxious in these models. Transgenic mice were widely used for testing AD therapeutic agents, and demonstrated promising results. Unfortunately, clinical trials resulted in unforeseen adverse events or negative therapeutic outcomes. The disparity between success and failure is in part attributable to evolutionary divergence between humans and rodents. These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of AD is by far more intricate than can be explained by a straightforward accumulation of A??. ?? 2009 The Alzheimer's Association.},

These are the law of mass action, which holds that the binding of one molecule to another increases with concentration, and the fact that the colocalization of molecules vastly increases their local concentrations. It follows that colocalization can amplify the effect on one protein of random mutations in another protein and can therefore, through natural selection, lead to interactions between proteins and to a startling variety of complex allosteric controls. It also follows that allostery is common and that homologous proteins can have different allosteric mechanisms. Thus, the regulated protein networks of organisms seem to be the inevitable consequence of natural selection operating under physical laws.},

However, these approaches require high coverage by long reads and remain expensive. On the other hand, the inexpensive short reads technologies produce accurate but fragmented assemblies. Thus, a hybrid approach that assembles long reads (with low coverage) and short reads has a potential to generate high-quality assemblies at reduced cost. Results: We describe hybridSPAdes algorithm for assembling short and long reads and benchmark it on a variety of bacterial assembly projects. Our results demonstrate that hybridSPAdes generates accurate assemblies (even in projects with relatively low coverage by long reads) thus reducing the overall cost of genome sequencing. We further present the first complete assembly of a genome from single cells using SMRT reads.

abstract = {The p53 tumor suppressor gene product, and the bcr-abl, bcl-2, and c-myc gene products all appear to influence the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis. In addition to the role p53 protein plays in mediating a cell cycle arrest in G1 following DNA damage, p53 also performs functions critical for removal of damaged cells by initiating apoptosis in certain physiological situations. Cells which express deregulated c-myc are sensitized to apoptosis following various growth suppressing stimuli and these observations have provided new insights into how apoptosis-suppressing genes such as mutant p53, bcl-2 and bcr-abl may cooperate during transformation and how they might influence the sensitivity of cells to radiation and chemotherapy.},

abstract = {In bacterial genome and metagenome sequencing, Illumina sequencers are most frequently used due to their high throughput capacity, and multiple library preparation kits have been developed for Illumina platforms. Here, we systematically analysed and compared the sequencing bias generated by currently available library preparation kits for Illumina sequencing. Our analyses revealed that a strong sequencing bias is introduced in low-GC regions by the Nextera XT kit. The level of bias introduced is dependent on the level of GC content; stronger bias is generated as the GC content decreases. Other analysed kits did not introduce this strong sequencing bias. The GC content-associated sequencing bias introduced by Nextera XT was more remarkable in metagenome sequencing of a mock bacterial community and seriously affected estimation of the relative abundance of low-GC species. The results of our analyses highlight the importance of selecting proper library preparation kits according to the purposes and targets of sequencing, particularly in metagenome sequencing, where a wide range of microbial species with various degrees of GC content is present. Our data also indicate that special attention should be paid to which library preparation kit was used when analysing and interpreting publicly available metagenomic data.},

Together with knowledge about homologous genes from model organisms, these features allow us to accurately predict the number of publications on individual human genes, the year of their first report, the levels of funding awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the development of drugs against disease-associated genes. By explicitly identifying the reasons for gene-specific bias and performing a meta-analysis of existing computational and experimental knowledge bases, we describe gene-specific strategies for the identification of important but hitherto ignored genes that can open novel directions for future investigation.},

@article{Hakes2007,
abstract = {Background: Genes in populations are in constant flux, being gained through duplication and occasionally retained or, more frequently, lost from the genome. In this study we compare pairs of identifiable gene duplicates generated by small-scale (predominantly single-gene) duplications with those created by a large-scale gene duplication event (whole-genome duplication) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results: We find a number of quantifiable differences between these data sets. Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. At first sight, either of these latter two features could provide a plausible mechanism by which the difference in dispensability might arise. However, we uncover no evidence suggesting that this is the case. We find that the difference in dispensability observed between the two duplicate types is limited to gene products found within protein complexes, and probably results from differences in the relative strength of the evolutionary pressures present following each type of duplication event. Conclusion: Genes, and the proteins they specify, originating from small-scale and whole-genome duplication events differ in quantifiable ways. We infer that this is not due to their association with different functional categories; rather, it is a direct result of biases in gene retention. {\textcopyright} 2007 Hakes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Interaction of the TolB box of Group A colicins with the TolB protein in the periplasm of Escherichia coli cells promotes transport of the cytotoxic domain of the colicin across the cell envelope. The crystal structure of a complex between a 107-residue peptide (TA(1-107)) of the translocation domain of colicin A (ColA) and TolB identified the TolB box as a 12-residue peptide that folded into a distorted hairpin within a central canyon of the beta-propeller domain of TolB. Comparison of this structure with that of the colicin E9 (ColE9) TolB box-TolB complex, together with site-directed mutagenesis of the ColA TolB box residues, revealed important differences in the interaction of the two TolB boxes with an overlapping binding site on TolB. Substitution of the TolB box residues of ColA with those of ColE9 conferred the ability to competitively recruit TolB from Pal but reduced the biological activity of the mutant ColA. This datum explains (i) the difference in binding affinities of ColA and ColE9 with TolB, and (ii) the inability of ColA, unlike ColE9, to competitively recruit TolB from Pal, allowing an understanding of how these two colicins interact in a different way with a common translocation portal in E. coli cells.},

They are the exponential diffusion kernel, the Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel, the von Neumann diffusion kernel, the regularized Laplacian kernel, the commute-time (or resistance-distance) kernel, the random-walk-with-restart similarity matrix, and finally, a kernel first introduced in this paper (the regularized commute-time kernel) and two kernels defined in some of our previous work and further investigated in this paper (the Markov diffusion kernel and the relative-entropy diffusion matrix). The kernel-on-graphs approach is simple and intuitive. It is illustrated by applying the nine kernels to a collaborative-recommendation task, viewed as a link prediction problem, and to a semisupervised classification task, both on several databases. The methods compute proximity measures between nodes that help study the structure of the graph. Our comparisons suggest that the regularized commute-time and the Markov diffusion kernels perform best on the investigated tasks, closely followed by the regularized Laplacian kernel. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Resistance to infection and clearance of cell debris in mammals depend on the activation of the complement system, which is an important component of innate and adaptive immunity. Central to the complement system is the activated form of C3, called C3b, which attaches covalently to target surfaces to amplify complement response, label cells for phagocytosis and stimulate the adaptive immune response. C3b consists of 1,560 amino-acid residues and has 12 domains. It binds various proteins and receptors to effect its functions. However, it is not known how C3 changes its conformation into C3b and thereby exposes its many binding sites. Here we present the crystal structure at 4-A resolution of the activated complement protein C3b and describe the conformational rearrangements of the 12 domains that take place upon proteolytic activation. In the activated form the thioester is fully exposed for covalent attachment to target surfaces and is more than 85 A away from the buried site in native C3 (ref. 5). Marked domain rearrangements in the alpha-chain present an altered molecular surface, exposing hidden and cryptic sites that are consistent with known putative binding sites of factor B and several complement regulators. The structural data indicate that the large conformational changes in the proteolytic activation and regulation of C3 take place mainly in the first conversion step, from C3 to C3b. These insights are important for the development of strategies to treat immune disorders that involve complement-mediated inflammation.},

To reveal the possible role of apoB-100 in neurodegeneration, we analyzed the serum lipoprotein and cerebral protein profiles, amyloid plaque formation, apoptosis and brain morphology of transgenic mice overexpressing the human apoB-100 protein. Serum lipoprotein profile showed significant increase of the plasma triglyceride level, while no alteration in total cholesterol was detected. The antibody microarray experiment revealed upregulation of several cytoskeletal, neuronal proteins and proteins that belong to the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, indicating active apoptosis in the brain. Histochemical experiments showed formation of amyloid plaques and extensive neuronal death. Biochemical changes severely affected brain morphology; a dramatic genotype-dependent enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles in the brain was detected. On the basis of earlier and present results, we conclude that overexpressed human apoB-100 protein significantly increases the level of serum lipids (triglyceride upon normal chow diet and cholesterol on cholesterol-rich diet) which leads to cerebrovascular lesions and subsequently induces apoptosis and neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) can differentiate into cardiomyocytes (CM) and represent a promising form of cellular therapy for heart regeneration. However, residual undifferentiated iPS derivates (iPSD), which are not fully eliminated by cell differentiation or purification protocols, may form tumors after transplantation, thus compromising therapeutic application. Inhibition of stearoyl-coA desaturase (SCD) has recently been reported to eliminate undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells, which share many features with iPSD. Here, we tested the effects of PluriSin{\#}1, a small-molecule inhibitor of SCD, on iPS-derived CM. We found that plurisin{\#}1 treatment significantly decreased the mRNA and protein level of Nanog, a marker for both cell pluripotency and tumor progression; importantly, we provide evidence that PluriSin{\#}1 treatment at 20 µM for 1 day significantly induces the apoptosis of Nanog-positive iPSD. In addition, PluriSin{\#}1 treatment at 20 µM for 4 days diminished Nanog-positive stem cells in cultured iPSD while not increasing apoptosis of iPS-derived CM. To investigate whether PluriSin{\#}1 treatment prevents tumorigenicity of iPSD after cell transplantation, we intramyocardially injected PluriSin{\#}1- or DMSO-treated iPSD in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). DMSO-treated iPSD readily formed Nanog-expressing tumors 2 weeks after injection, which was prevented by treatment with PluriSin{\#}1. Moreover, treatment with PluriSin{\#}1 did not change the expression of cTnI, $\alpha$-MHC, or MLC-2v, markers of cardiac differentiation (P{\textgreater}0.05, n = 4).

abstract = {Tuning the properties of maleimide reagents holds significant promise in expanding the toolbox of available methods for bioconjugation. Herein we describe aryloxymaleimides which represent 'next generation maleimides' of attenuated reactivity, and demonstrate their ability to enable new methods for protein modification at disulfide bonds. The maleimide motif 1 is a highly reactive conjugate acceptor and can be employed effectively in selective reactions with thiols, such as cysteine residues in proteins. 1 As a result it is one of the most widely used functional groups in bioconjugation (Scheme 1). We have recently described bromomaleimides 3 as the parent members of a new class of reagents, which can be termed 'next generation maleimides' (NGMs). The incorporation of the leaving group leads to a switch in the mechanism that occurs upon reaction with a thiol, from an addition reaction to an addition–elimination reaction. The result is the formation of a thiomaleimide product 4, rather than thiosuccinimide 2. Such next generation maleimide reagents enable new applications including reversible cysteine modification, 2 the construction of triconjugates, 2b,3 and the bridging of disulfide bonds. 2b,4 We envisaged that the choice of leaving group on the maleimide core could result in reagents with finely tuned properties. For example the reactivity could be controlled, in a manner similar to the use of iodo-, bromo-and chloroacetamides as varyingly reactive reagents for selective cysteine modification. 5 In addition to guiding the reactivity, the choice of leaving group could also control other properties of the reagents, such as aqueous solubility. Herein we report on the aryloxymaleimides, as NGMs of attenuated reactivity, and demonstrate application of these reagents in cysteine modification and in new modes of conjugation of disulfide bonds. Having previously shown that thiophenol served as a suitable leaving group in dithiophenolmaleimide reagents, 4b we postulated that phenol may do like-wise. Furthermore we considered that the increased mesomeric contribution from the oxygen into the maleimide ring would lead to reagents of reduced electrophilicity. The synthesis of aryloxymaleimides 6–8 was carried out by simple addition of the corresponding phenol to N-methyl bromomaleimide 5 (Scheme 2). Addition of these reagents to a model protein, the single cysteine mutant (L111C) of the SH2 domain of the Grb2 adaptor protein 9, 2b was monitored over 2 hours and compared to the use of bromomaleimide 5 (Fig. 1). All three aryloxymaleimides underwent the desired addition–elimination reaction to afford thiomaleimide conjugate 10, at a reduced rate compared to bromomaleimide 5. 2b As expected, the incorporation of electron Scheme 1 Cysteine labelling of proteins using maleimide 1 and next generation maleimide (NGM) 3.},

abstract = {Pyruvate kinase (PK) is critical for the regulation of the glycolytic pathway. The regulatory properties of Escherichia coli were investigated by mutating six charged residues involved in interdomain salt bridges (Arg(271), Arg(292), Asp(297), and Lys(413)) and in the binding of the allosteric activator (Lys(382) and Arg(431)). Arg(271) and Lys(413) are located at the interface between A and C domains within one subunit. The R271L and K413Q mutant enzymes exhibit altered kinetic properties. In K413Q, there is partial enzyme activation, whereas R271L is characterized by a bias toward the T-state in the allosteric equilibrium. In the T-state, Arg(292) and Asp(297) form an intersubunit salt bridge. The mutants R292D and D297R are totally inactive. The crystal structure of R292D reveals that the mutant enzyme retains the T-state quaternary structure. However, the mutation induces a reorganization of the interface with the creation of a network of interactions similar to that observed in the crystal structures of R-state yeast and M1 PK proteins. Furthermore, in the R292D structure, two loops that are part of the active site are disordered. The K382Q and R431E mutations were designed to probe the binding site for fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, the allosteric activator. R431E exhibits only slight changes in the regulatory properties. Conversely, K382Q displays a highly altered responsiveness to the activator, suggesting that Lys(382) is involved in both activator binding and allosteric transition mechanism. Taken together, these results support the notion that domain interfaces are critical for the allosteric transition. They couple changes in the tertiary and quaternary structures to alterations in the geometry of the fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate and substrate binding sites. These site-directed mutagenesis data are discussed in the light of the molecular basis for the hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, which is caused by mutations in human erythrocyte PK gene.},

abstract = {In cellular signal transduction, the information in an external stimulus is encoded in temporal patterns in the activities of signaling molecules; for example, pulses of a stimulus may produce an increasing response or may produce pulsatile responses in the signaling molecules. Here, we show how the Akt pathway, which is involved in cell growth, specifically transmits temporal information contained in upstream signals to downstream effectors. We modeled the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Akt pathway in PC12 cells on the basis of experimental results. We obtained counterintuitive results indicating that the sizes of the peak amplitudes of receptor and downstream effector phosphorylation were decoupled; weak, sustained EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, rather than strong, transient phosphorylation, strongly induced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, a molecule downstream of Akt. Using frequency response analysis, we found that a three-component Akt pathway exhibited the property of a low-pass filter and that this property could explain decoupling of the peak amplitudes of receptor phosphorylation and that of downstream effectors. Furthermore, we found that lapatinib, an EGFR inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, converted strong, transient Akt phosphorylation into weak, sustained Akt phosphorylation, and, because of the low-pass filter characteristics of the Akt pathway, this led to stronger S6 phosphorylation than occurred in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, an EGFR inhibitor can potentially act as a downstream activator of some effectors. Copyright 2008 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science; all rights reserved.},

BetP adjusts its transport activity by sensing the cytoplasmic K(+) concentration as a measure for hyperosmotic stress via the osmosensing carboxy-terminal domain. BetP needs to be in a trimeric state for communication between individual protomers through several intratrimeric interaction sites. Recently, crystal structures of inward-facing BetP trimers have contributed to our understanding of activity regulation on a molecular level. Here we report new crystal structures, which reveal two conformationally asymmetric BetP trimers, capturing among them three distinct transport states. We observe a total of four new conformations at once: an outward-open apo and an outward-occluded apo state, and two closed transition states--one in complex with betaine and one substrate-free. On the basis of these new structures, we identified local and global conformational changes in BetP that underlie the molecular transport mechanism, which partially resemble structural changes observed in other sodium-coupled LeuT-like fold transporters, but show differences we attribute to the osmolytic nature of betaine, the exclusive substrate specificity and the regulatory properties of BetP.},

Assembly and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) metrics for both microbes and viruses were determined from Illumina-only assemblies and a hybrid assembly approach. Strikingly, the hybrid approach more than doubled the number of mid to high-quality MAGs ({\textgreater} 50{\%} completion, {\textless} 10{\%} redundancy), generated nearly four-fold more phage genomes, and improved all associated genome metrics relative to the Illumina only method. The hybrid assemblies yielded MAGs that were on average 7.8{\%} more complete, with 133 fewer contigs and a 14 kbp greater N50. Furthermore, the longer contigs from the hybrid approach generated microbial MAGs that had a higher proportion of rRNA genes. We demonstrate this usefulness by linking microbial MAGs containing 16S rRNA genes with extensive amplicon dataset.

Immunodeficiency patients have increased susceptibility to recurrent and persistent, even life-threatening infections. Mutations in a large number of genes can cause defects in different cellular functions and lead to impaired immune response. To date, approximately 150 IDs and more than 100 affected genes have been identified. ID-related genes are distributed throughout the genome, and diseases can be inherited in an X-linked, an autosomal recessive, or an autosomal dominant way. We have collected ID mutation data into locus-specific patient-related mutation databases, IDbases (http://bioinf.uta.fi/IDbases). Mutations are described at DNA, mRNA, and protein levels with links to reference sequences and reference articles. The mutation data has been collated into entries along with some clinical information. IDbases offer an easy way, e.g., to find recently identified mutations, to reveal genotype-phenotype correlations, and to discover a specific mutation or to examine the most common mutations in a single immunodeficiency related gene. At the moment we have databases for 107 ID genes with 4,140 public patient entries. An exhaustive statistical analysis of mutation data from the IDbases was made. Missense and nonsense mutations are the most common mutation types, and the most common single substitution is a nonsense mutation from tryptophan to a stop codon. Arginine is the most mutated as well as the most abundant mutant amino acid.},

They have revealed novel molecular markers of cancer subtypes, metastasis, and drug sensitivity and resistance. Some have been translated into the clinic as tools for early disease diagnosis, prognosis, and individualized treatment and response monitoring. Despite these successes, many challenges remain: HTP platforms are often noisy and suffer from false positives and false negatives; optimal analysis and successful validation require complex workflows; and great volumes of data are accumulating at a rapid pace. Here we discuss these challenges, and show how integrative computational biology can help diminish them by creating new software tools, analytical methods, and data standards.},

The repair of DSBs involves both posttranslational modification of nucleosomes and concentration of DNA-repair proteins at the site of damage. Consequently, nucleosome packing and chromatin architecture surrounding the DSB may limit the ability of the DNA-damage response to access and repair the break.

abstract = {With the growing availability of large-scale biological datasets, automated methods of extracting functionally meaningful information from this data are becoming increasingly important. Data relating to functional association between genes or proteins, such as co-expression or functional association, is often represented in terms of gene or protein networks. Several methods of predicting gene function from these networks have been proposed. However, evaluating the relative performance of these algorithms may not be trivial: concerns have been raised over biases in different benchmarking methods and datasets, particularly relating to non-independence of functional association data and test data. In this paper we propose a new network-based gene function prediction algorithm using a commute-time kernel and partial least squares regression (Compass). We compare Compass to GeneMANIA, a leading network-based prediction algorithm, using a number of different benchmarks, and find that Compass outperforms GeneMANIA on these benchmarks. We also explicitly explore problems associated with the non-independence of functional association data and test data. We find that a benchmark based on the Gene Ontology database, which, directly or indirectly, incorporates information from other databases, may considerably overestimate the performance of algorithms exploiting functional association data for prediction.},

abstract = {Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1$\Delta$E9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1{\_}E9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1$\Delta$E9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, A$\beta$ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.},

abstract = {Protein domains mediate drug-protein interactions and this principle can guide the design of multi-target drugs i.e. polypharmacology. In this study, we associate multi-target drugs with CATH functional families through the overrepresentation of targets of those drugs in CATH functional families. Thus, we identify CATH functional families that are currently enriched in drugs (druggable CATH functional families) and we use the network properties of these druggable protein families to analyse their association with drug side effects. Analysis of selected druggable CATH functional families, enriched in drug targets, show that relatives exhibit highly conserved drug binding sites. Furthermore, relatives within druggable CATH functional families occupy central positions in a human protein functional network, cluster together forming network neighbourhoods and are less likely to be within proteins associated with drug side effects. Our results demonstrate that CATH functional families can be used to identify drug-target interactions, opening a new research direction in target identification.},

One of the main goals of SNP research is to understand the genetics of the human phenotype variation and especially the genetic basis of human complex diseases. Non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) comprise a group of SNPs that, together with SNPs in regulatory regions, are believed to have the highest impact on phenotype. Here we present a World Wide Web server to predict the effect of an nsSNP on protein structure and function. The prediction method enabled analysis of the publicly available SNP database HGVbase, which gave rise to a dataset of nsSNPs with predicted functionality. The dataset was further used to compare the effect of various structural and functional characteristics of amino acid substitutions responsible for phenotypic display of nsSNPs. We also studied the dependence of selective pressure on the structural and functional properties of proteins. We found that in our dataset the selection pressure against deleterious SNPs depends on the molecular function of the protein, although it is insensitive to several other protein features considered. The strongest selective pressure was detected for proteins involved in transcription regulation.},

RESULTS: One thousand and six completed forms were received from declared users, making this the largest survey on mephedrone to date. CONCLUSION: Results showed that mephedrone users consider its effects to compare best with those of MDMA, and while MDMA was considered marginally safer and its effects more pleasurable, mephedrone's appeal lay in its availability, low price and reliable purity.},

abstract = {The study of colicin release from producing cells has revealed a novel mechanism of secretion. Instead of a built-in 'tag', such as a signal peptide containing information for secretion, the mechanism employs coordinate expression of a small protein which causes an increase in the envelope permeability, resulting in the release of the colicin as well as other proteins. On the other hand, the mechanism of entry of colicins into sensitive cells involves the same three stages of protein translocation that have been demonstrated for various cellular organelles. They first interact with receptors located at the surface of the outer membrane and are then transferred across the cell envelope in a process that requires energy and depends upon accessory proteins (TolA, TolB, TolC, TolQ, TolR) which might play a role similar to that of the secretory apparatus of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. At this point, the type of colicin described in this review interacts specifically with the inner membrane to form an ion channel. The pore-forming colicins are isolated as soluble proteins and yet insert spontaneously into lipid bilayers. The three-dimensional structures of some of these colicins should soon become available and site-directed mutagenesis studies have now provided a large number of modified polypeptides. Their use in model systems, particularly those in which the role of transmembrane potential can be tested for polypeptide insertion and ionic channel gating, constitutes a powerful handle with which to improve our understanding of the dynamics of protein insertion into and across membranes and the molecular basis of membrane excitability. In addition, their immunity proteins, which exist only in one state (membrane-inserted) will also contribute to such an understanding.},

The function of BRCA2 in recombination is to control RAD51, a protein that catalyzes homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange. By physically interacting with both RAD51 and single-stranded DNA, BRCA2 mediates delivery of RAD51 preferentially to sites of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) exposed as a result of DNA damage or replication problems. Through its action, BRCA2 helps restore and maintain integrity of the genome. This review highlights recent studies on BRCA2 and its orthologs that have begun to illuminate the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins control homologous recombination.},

abstract = {Mechanistic analysis of transcriptional initiation and termination by RNA polymerase II (PolII) indicates that some factors are common to both processes. Here we show that two long genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FMP27 and SEN1, exist in a looped conformation, effectively bringing together their promoter and terminator regions. We also show that PolII is located at both ends of FMP27 when this gene is transcribed from a GAL1 promoter under induced and noninduced conditions. Under these conditions, the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of PolII is phosphorylated at Ser5. Notably, inactivation of Kin28p causes a loss of both Ser5 phosphorylation and the loop conformation. These data suggest that gene loops are involved in the early stages of transcriptional activation. They also predict a previously unknown structural dimension to gene regulation, in which both ends of the transcription unit are defined before and during the transcription cycle.},

This is particularly problematic when applying the latest machine learning algorithms to solve problems in biological sequence analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train distributed representations of variable-length k-mers. Our method is based on the popular word embedding model word2vec, which is trained on a shallow two-layer neural network. Our experiments provide evidence that the summing of dna2vec vectors is akin to nucleotides concatenation. We also demonstrate that there is correlation between Needleman-Wunsch similarity score and cosine similarity of dna2vec vectors.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative condition for which there are no effective treatments. Understanding the molecular pathology of AD during disease progression may identify new ways to reduce neuronal damage. Here, we present a longitudinal study tracking dynamic proteomic alterations in the brains of an inducible Drosophila melanogaster model of AD expressing the Arctic mutant A$\beta$42 gene. We identified 3093 proteins from flies that were induced to express A$\beta$42 and age-matched healthy controls using label-free quantitative ion-mobility data independent analysis mass spectrometry. Of these, 228 proteins were significantly altered by A$\beta$42 accumulation and were enriched for AD-associated processes. Network analyses further revealed that these proteins have distinct hub and bottleneck properties in the brain protein interaction network, suggesting that several may have significant effects on brain function. Our unbiased analysis provides useful insights into the key processes governing the progression of amyloid toxicity and forms a basis for further functional analyses in model organisms and translation to mammalian systems.},

abstract = {We have previously formulated a list of approximately 2,000 RNA octamers as putative exonic splicing enhancers (PESEs) based on a statistical comparison of human exonic and nonexonic sequences (X. H. Zhang and L. A. Chasin, Genes Dev. 18:1241-1250, 2004). When inserted into a poorly spliced test exon, all eight tested octamers stimulated splicing, a result consistent with their identification as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). Here we present a much more stringent test of the validity of this list of PESEs. Twenty-two naturally occurring examples of nonoverlapping PESEs or PESE clusters were identified in six mammalian exons; five of the six exons tested are constitutively spliced. Each of the 22 individual PESEs or PESE clusters was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis, usually by a single-base substitution. Eighteen of the 22 disruptions (82{\%}) resulted in decreased splicing efficiency. In contrast, 24 control mutations had little or no effect on splicing. This high rate of success suggests that most PESEs function as ESEs in their natural context. Like most exons, these exons contain several PESEs. Since knocking out any one of several could produce a severalfold decrease in splicing efficiency, we conclude that there is little redundancy among ESEs in an exon and that they must work in concert to optimize splicing.},

abstract = {Motivation: It is well known that patterns of differential gene expression across biological conditions are often shared by many genes, particularly those within functional groups. Taking advantage of these patterns can lead to increased statistical power and biological clarity when testing for differential expression in a microarray experiment. The optimal discovery procedure (ODP), which maximizes the expected number of true positives for each fixed number of expected false positives, is a framework aimed at this goal. Storey et al. introduced an estimator of the ODP for identifying differentially expressed genes. However, their ODP estimator grows quadratically in computational time with respect to the number of genes. Reducing this computational burden is a key step in making the ODP practical for usage in a variety of high-throughput problems. Results: Here, we propose a new estimate of the ODP called the modular ODP (mODP). The existing 'full ODP' requires that the likelihood function for each gene be evaluated according to the parameter estimates for all genes. The mODP assigns genes to modules according to a Kullback-Leibler distance, and then evaluates the statistic only at the module-averaged parameter estimates. We show that the mODP is relatively insensitive to the choice of the number of modules, but dramatically reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of genes. We compare the full ODP algorithm and mODP on simulated data and gene expression data from a recent study of Morrocan Amazighs. The mODP and full ODP algorithm perform very similarly across a range of comparisons. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Despite extensive studies on AD pathology for more than 100 years, there are no disease-preventing therapies. Growing evidence suggests the role of calcium (Ca2+) in the pathogenesis of AD. The main purpose of the article is to understand whether modern science is able to explain the synapse loss observed in early AD and discuss the role of Ca2+ hypothesis in it. Based on results obtained in our laboratory and others, we propose that familial AD-associated mutations in presenilins cause a Ca2+ overload of endoplasmic reticulum stores which leads to compensatory downregulation of the neuronal store-operated Ca2+ (nSOC) entry pathway. We propose that synaptic nSOC is necessary for the stability of mature synaptic spines and that dysfunction of this pathway may play an important role in synaptic and memory loss in AD.},

Important chemical changes of polymeric chains were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. After the microscopic and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies, specific microbial media was used to isolate and identify the bacteria from the degrading polyethylene terephthalate. Degradation impact by microbes on the crystalline structure and presence of microbes inside the polyethylene terephthalate were seen in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs. A record of loss in weight and tensile strength were also made. Esterase was found to be involved in the biodegradation. Although the biodegradation was slow and weak, we demonstrated with chemical and x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) as well as with SEM micrographs that microbes and esterase could act on the polyethylene terephthalate. The microbe involved was confirmed to be a Nocardia species.},

abstract = {Nuclease colicins bind their target receptor in the outer membrane of sensitive cells in the form of a high affinity complex with their cognate immunity proteins. Upon cell entry the immunity protein is lost from the complex by means that are poorly understood. We have developed a sensitive fluorescence assay that has enabled us to study the molecular requirements for immunity protein release. Nuclease colicins use members of the tol operon for their translocation across the outer membrane. We have demonstrated that the amino-terminal 80 residues of the colicin E9 molecule, which is the region that interacts with TolB, are essential for immunity protein release. Using tol deletion strains we analyzed the cellular components necessary for immunity protein release and found that in addition to a requirement for tolB, the tolA deletion strain was most affected. Complementation studies showed that the mutation H22A, within the transmembrane segment of TolA, abolishes immunity protein release. Investigation of the energy requirements demonstrated that the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane is critical. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time a clear energy requirement for the uptake of a nuclease colicin complex and suggest that energy transduced from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane by TolA could be the driving force for immunity protein release and concomitant translocation of the nuclease domain.},

abstract = {A strategy of rationally engineering protein surfaces with the aim of obtaining mutants that are distinctly more susceptible to crystallization than the wild-type protein has previously been suggested. The strategy relies on replacing small clusters of two to three surface residues characterized by high conformational entropy with alanines. This surface entropy reduction (or SER) method has proven to be an effective salvage pathway for proteins that are difficult to crystallize. Here, a systematic comparison of the efficacy of using Ala, His, Ser, Thr and Tyr to replace high-entropy residues is reported. A total of 40 mutants were generated and screened using two different procedures. The results reaffirm that alanine is a particularly good choice for a replacement residue and identify tyrosines and threonines as additional candidates that have considerable potential to mediate crystal contacts. The propensity of these mutants to form crystals in alternative screens in which the normal crystallization reservoir solutions were replaced with 1.5 M NaCl was also examined. The results were impressive: more than half of the mutants yielded a larger number of crystals with salt as the reservoir solution. This method greatly increased the variety of conditions that yielded crystals. Taken together, these results suggest a powerful crystallization strategy that combines surface engineering with efficient screening using standard and alternate reservoir solutions.},

Recent studies challenge this theory by demonstrating that in some cases, longevity is enhanced by inactivation of oxidative stress defenses or is correlated with increased, rather than decreased reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage. Here we show that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, caloric restriction or inactivation of catalases extends chronological lifespan by inducing elevated levels of the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, which activate superoxide dismutases that inhibit the accumulation of superoxide anions. Increased hydrogen peroxide in catalase-deficient cells extends chronological lifespan despite parallel increases in oxidative damage. These findings establish a role for hormesis effects of hydrogen peroxide in promoting longevity that have broad implications for understanding aging and age-related diseases.},

abstract = {Carbon fixation is the process by which CO(2) is incorporated into organic compounds. In modern agriculture in which water, light, and nutrients can be abundant, carbon fixation could become a significant growth-limiting factor. Hence, increasing the fixation rate is of major importance in the road toward sustainability in food and energy production. There have been recent attempts to improve the rate and specificity of Rubisco, the carboxylating enzyme operating in the Calvin-Benson cycle; however, they have achieved only limited success. Nature employs several alternative carbon fixation pathways, which prompted us to ask whether more efficient novel synthetic cycles could be devised. Using the entire repertoire of approximately 5,000 metabolic enzymes known to occur in nature, we computationally identified alternative carbon fixation pathways that combine existing metabolic building blocks from various organisms. We compared the natural and synthetic pathways based on physicochemical criteria that include kinetics, energetics, and topology. Our study suggests that some of the proposed synthetic pathways could have significant quantitative advantages over their natural counterparts, such as the overall kinetic rate. One such cycle, which is predicted to be two to three times faster than the Calvin-Benson cycle, employs the most effective carboxylating enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, using the core of the naturally evolved C4 cycle. Although implementing such alternative cycles presents daunting challenges related to expression levels, activity, stability, localization, and regulation, we believe our findings suggest exciting avenues of exploration in the grand challenge of enhancing food and renewable fuel production via metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.},

The progress of DNA repair processes involving one or more caffeine-sensitive steps may be conveniently followed by measuring the concomitant decrease of this lethal enhancement effect. By measuring, during post-irradiation incubation, the ability of cells to overcome susceptibility to repair inhibition by caffeine, we have determined the time course and requirements for repair in S. pombe. Recovery began immediately and took 150-200 min after $\gamma$-irradiation and more than 500 min after UV-irradiation, for exposures which gave about 10{\%} survival in the absence of caffeine. An incubation medium capable of supporting growth was required for caffeine-sensitive repair; no recovery occurred under liquid holding conditions. Survival curves after various recovery times indicated that a logarithmic phase cell population was homogeneous with respect to caffeine-sensitive repair of both UV- and $\gamma$-ray-induced damage. Recovery from caffeine inhibition was compared for cells of different physiological states (logarithmic and stationary phase); although the importance of the physiological state was not the same for the two types of radiation, recovery was found to occur more rapidly in the more radiation-resistant state, in each case. {\textcopyright} 1975 Springer-Verlag.},

We have addressed this by developing transgenic models that express A$\beta$1-40 or A$\beta$1-42 in the absence of human amyloid $\beta$ protein precursor (APP) overexpression. Mice expressing high levels of A$\beta$1-40 do not develop overt amyloid pathology. In contrast, mice expressing lower levels of A$\beta$1-42 accumulate insoluble A$\beta$1-42 and develop compact amyloid plaques, congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and diffuse A$\beta$ deposits. When mice expressing A$\beta$1-42 are crossed with mutant APP (Tg2576) mice, there is also a massive increase in amyloid deposition.

abstract = {The last few years have witnessed significant changes in Pfam (https://pfam.xfam.org). The number of families has grown substantially to a total of 17,929 in release 32.0. New additions have been coupled with efforts to improve existing families, including refinement of domain boundaries, their classification into Pfam clans, as well as their functional annotation. We recently began to collaborate with the RepeatsDB resource to improve the definition of tandem repeat families within Pfam. We carried out a significant comparison to the structural classification database, namely the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) that led to the creation of 825 new families based on their set of uncharacterized families{\^{A}} (EUFs). Furthermore, we also connected Pfam entries to the Sequence Ontology (SO) through mapping of the Pfam type definitions to SO terms. Since Pfam has many community contributors, we recently enabled the linking between authorship of all Pfam entries with the corresponding authors- ORCID identifiers. This effectively permits authors to claim credit for their Pfam curation and link them to their ORCID record.},

abstract = {In different phases of the transcription cycle, RNA polymerase (Pol) II recruits various factors via its C-terminal domain (CTD), which consists of conserved heptapeptide repeats with the sequence Tyr(1)-Ser(2)-Pro(3)-Thr(4)-Ser(5)-Pro(6)-Ser(7). We show that the CTD of transcribing yeast Pol II is phosphorylated at Tyr(1), in addition to Ser(2), Thr(4), Ser(5), and Ser(7). Tyr(1) phosphorylation stimulates binding of elongation factor Spt6 and impairs recruitment of termination factors Nrd1, Pcf11, and Rtt103. Tyr(1) phosphorylation levels rise downstream of the transcription start site and decrease before the polyadenylation site, largely excluding termination factors from gene bodies. These results show that CTD modifications trigger and block factor recruitment and lead to an extended CTD code that explains transcription cycle coordination on the basis of differential phosphorylation of Tyr(1), Ser(2), and Ser(5).},

@article{Wick2019,
abstract = {Background: Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here, we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish. Results: Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ('polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy. Conclusions: Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.},

abstract = {Splice site consensus sequences alone are insufficient to dictate the recognition of real constitutive splice sites within the typically large transcripts of higher eukaryotes, and large numbers of pseudoexons flanked by pseudosplice sites with good matches to the consensus sequences can be easily designated. In an attempt to identify elements that prevent pseudoexon splicing, we have systematically altered known splicing signals, as well as immediately adjacent flanking sequences, of an arbitrarily chosen pseudoexon from intron 1 of the human hprt gene. The substitution of a 5' splice site that perfectly matches the 5' consensus combined with mutation to match the CAG/G sequence of the 3' consensus failed to get this model pseudoexon included as the central exon in a dhfr minigene context. Provision of a real 3' splice site and a consensus 5' splice site and removal of an upstream inhibitory sequence were necessary and sufficient to confer splicing on the pseudoexon. This activated context also supported the splicing of a second pseudoexon sequence containing no apparent enhancer. Thus, both the 5' splice site sequence and the polypyrimidine tract of the pseudoexon are defective despite their good agreement with the consensus. On the other hand, the pseudoexon body did not exert a negative influence on splicing. The introduction into the pseudoexon of a sequence selected for binding to ASF/SF2 or its replacement with beta-globin exon 2 only partially reversed the effect of the upstream negative element and the defective polypyrimidine tract. These results support the idea that exon-bridging enhancers are not a prerequisite for constitutive exon definition and suggest that intrinsically defective splice sites and negative elements play important roles in distinguishing the real splicing signal from the vast number of false splicing signals.},

@article{Rang2011,
abstract = {Single-celled organisms dividing by binary fission were thought not to age [1-4]. A 2005 study by Stewart et al. [5] reversed the dogma by demonstrating that Escherichia coli were susceptible to aging. A follow-up study by Wang et al. [6] countered those results by demonstrating that E. coli cells trapped in microfluidic devices are able to sustain robust growth without aging. The present study reanalyzed these conflicting data by applying a population genetic model for aging in bacteria [7]. Our reanalysis showed that in E. coli, as predicted by the model, (1) aging and rejuvenation occurred simultaneously in a population; (2) lineages receiving sequentially the maternal old pole converged to a stable attractor state; (3) lineages receiving sequentially the maternal new pole converged to an equivalent but separate attractor state; (4) cells at the old pole attractor had a longer doubling time than ones at the new pole attractor; and (5) the robust growth state identified by Wang et al. corresponds to our predicted attractor for lineages harboring the maternal old pole. Thus, the previous data, rather than opposing each other, together provide strong evidence for bacterial aging. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The functions of two conserved residues, Phe(135) and Pro(136), located at the apex of the Cys loop of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are investigated. Both residues were substituted with natural and unnatural amino acids, focusing on the role of aromaticity at Phe(135), backbone conformation at Pro(136), side chain polarity and volume, and the specific interaction between the aromatic side chain and the proline. NMR spectroscopy studies of model peptides containing proline and unnatural proline analogues following a Phe show a consistent increase in the population of the cis conformer relative to peptides lacking the Phe. In the receptor, a strong interaction between the Phe and Pro residues is evident, as is a strong preference for aromaticity and hydrophobicity at the Phe site. A similar influence of hydrophobicity is observed at the proline site. In addition, across a simple homologous series of proline analogues, the results reveal a correlation between receptor function and cis bias at the proline backbone. This could suggest a significant role for the cis proline conformer at this site in receptor function.},

abstract = {It is more evident now than ever that nucleosomes can transmit epigenetic information from one cell generation to the next. It has been demonstrated during the past decade that the posttranslational modifications of histone proteins within the chromosome impact chromatin structure, gene transcription, and epigenetic information. Multiple modifications decorate each histone tail within the nucleosome, including some amino acids that can be modified in several different ways. Covalent modifications of histone tails known thus far include acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. A large body of experimental evidence compiled during the past several years has demonstrated the impact of histone acetylation on transcriptional control. Although histone modification by methylation and ubiquitination was discovered long ago, it was only recently that functional roles for these modifications in transcriptional regulation began to surface. Highlighted in this review are the recent biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of histone methylation and ubiquitination involved in the regulation of gene expression as determined by a combination of enzymological, structural, and genetic methodologies.},

They range from small lanthipeptides produced by lactic acid bacteria to much larger multi domain proteins of Gram negative bacteria such as the colicins from Escherichia coli. For activity bacteriocins must be released from the producing cell and then bind to the surface of a sensitive cell to instigate the import process leading to cell death. For over 50years, colicins have provided a working platform for elucidating the structure/function studies of bacteriocin import and modes of action. An understanding of the processes that contribute to the delivery of a colicin molecule across two lipid membranes of the cell envelope has advanced our knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPI), protein-lipid interactions and the role of order-disorder transitions of protein domains pertinent to protein transport. In this review, we provide an overview of the arrangement of genes that controls the synthesis and release of the mature protein. We examine the uptake processes of colicins from initial binding and sequestration of binding partners to crossing of the outer membrane, and then discuss the translocation of colicins through the cell periplasm and across the inner membrane to their cytotoxic site of action.

This simple definition belies a diverse and complex transcriptional module. There are two major types of core promoters - focused and dispersed. Focused promoters contain either a single transcription start site or a distinct cluster of start sites over several nucleotides, whereas dispersed promoters contain several start sites over 50-100 nucleotides and are typically found in CpG islands in vertebrates. Focused promoters are more ancient and widespread throughout nature than dispersed promoters; however, in vertebrates, dispersed promoters are more common than focused promoters. In addition, core promoters may contain many different sequence motifs, such as the TATA box, BRE, Inr, MTE, DPE, DCE, and XCPE1, that specify different mechanisms of transcription and responses to enhancers. Thus, the core promoter is a sophisticated gateway to transcription that determines which signals will lead to transcription initiation.},

abstract = {In order to carry out photosynthesis, plants and algae rely on the co-operative interaction of two photosystems: photosystem I and photosystem II. For maximum efficiency, each photosystem should absorb the same amount of light. To achieve this, plants and green algae have a mobile pool of chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins that can switch between being light-harvesting antenna for photosystem I or photosystem II, in order to maintain an optimal excitation balance. This switch, termed state transitions, involves the reversible phosphorylation of the mobile chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, which is regulated by the redox state of the plastoquinone-mediating electron transfer between photosystem I and photosystem II. In this review, we will present the data supporting the function of redox-dependent phosphorylation of the major and minor chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins by the specific thylakoid-bound kinases (Stt7, STN7, TAKs) providing a molecular switch for the structural remodelling of the light-harvesting complexes during state transitions. We will also overview the latest X-ray crystallographic and electron microscopy-derived models for structural re-arrangement of the light-harvesting antenna during State 1-to-State 2 transition, in which the minor chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, CP29, and the mobile light-harvesting complex II trimer detach from the light-harvesting complex II-photosystem II supercomplex and associate with the photosystem I core in the vicinity of the PsaH/L/O/P domain.},

More recently, the pace of functional discovery has slowed, leaving around 20{\%} of the proteins even in well-studied model organisms without informative descriptions of their biological roles. Remarkably, many uncharacterized proteins are conserved from yeasts to human, suggesting that they contribute to fundamental biological processes (BP). To fully understand biological systems in health and disease, we need to account for every part of the system. Unstudied proteins thus represent a collective blind spot that limits the progress of both basic and applied biosciences. We use a simple yet powerful metric based on Gene Ontology BP terms to define characterized and uncharacterized proteins for human, budding yeast and fission yeast. We then identify a set of conserved but unstudied proteins in S. pombe, and classify them based on a combination of orthogonal attributes determined by large-scale experimental and comparative methods.

abstract = {The requirement for the activation of phospholipase A by the colicin A lysis protein (Cal) in the efficient release of colicin A by Escherichia coli cells containing colicin A plasmids was studied. In particular, we wished to determine if this activation is the primary effect of Cal or whether it reflects more generalized damage to the envelope caused by the presence of large quantities of this small acylated protein. E. coli tolQ cells, which were shown to be leaky for periplasmic proteins, were transduced to pldA and then transformed with the recombinant colicin A plasmid pKA. Both the pldA and pldA+ strains released large quantities of colicin A following induction, indicating that in these cells phospholipase A activation is not required for colicin release. This release was, however, still dependent on a functioning Cal protein. The assembly and processing of Cal in situ in the cell envelope was studied by combining pulse-chase labelling with isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the cell membranes. Precursor Cal and lipid-modified precursor Cal were found in the inner membrane at early times of chase, and gave rise to mature Cal which accumulated in both the inner and outer membrane after further chase. The signal peptide was also visible on these gradients, and its distribution too was restricted to the inner membrane. Gradient centrifugation of envelopes of cells which were overproducing Cal resulted in very poor separation of the membranes. The results of these studies provide evidence that the colicin A lysis protein causes phospholipase A-independent alterations in the integrity of the E. coli envelope.},

These include telomere malfunction, oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Ultimately, such events culminate in the activation of a tumor suppressor gene network. Since the first description of Oncogene-Induced cellular Senescence (OIS) little over a decade ago, many subsequent studies have confirmed that OIS prevents cells from undergoing oncogenic transformation in vitro. However, it has long been debated whether any in vivo correlates exist. It is only since recent years that evidence has been accumulating indicating that OIS in vivo does correspond to a major protective mechanism against cancer. In this review, we highlight some of the recent developments. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The amyloid-$\beta$ peptide has been examined in various solvents and conditions and this has led to a model by which a conformational switching occurs from $\alpha$-helix or random coil, to a $\beta$-sheet structure. Amyloid fibril assembly proceeds by a nucleation dependent pathway leading to elongation of the fibrils. Along this pathway small oligomeric intermediates and short fibrillar structures (protofibrils) have been observed. In cross-section the fibril appears to be composed of several subfibrils or protofilaments. Each of these protofilaments is composed of $\beta$-sheet structure in which hydrogen bonding occurs along the length of the fibre and the $\beta$-strands run perpendicular to the fibre axis. This hierarchy of structure is discussed in this review.},

abstract = {Ion channels are generally multi-subunit complexes, with the ion conduction pathway formed at the subunit interface. In moving between the closed and open states, three structurally distinct channels, represented by the recently determined structures of a mechanosensitive, ligand-gated and K(+) selective channel, all move transmembrane helices away from the central ion conduction pathway. In all three cases, this results in the displacement of a hydrophobic gate from the ion conduction pathway, freeing ion movement. The channels achieve this by moving the transmembrane helices as rigid bodies using three major types of motion: MscL tilts its helices, the nicotinic ACh receptor rotates its helices, and KirBac1.1 bends its helices. In all cases, the gating motions are likely to take place rapidly. These large and fast movements provide a possible explanation for why the conduction pathways of a wide range of different ion channels are formed at the interface between subunits.},

abstract = {We study an expansion of the log likelihood in undirected graphical models such as the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), where each term in the expansion is associated with a sample in a Gibbs chain alternating between two random variables (the visible vector and the hidden vector in RBMs). We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncation--running only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the contrastive divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked autoassociators. The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs and requires only convergence of the Gibbs chain. We present theoretical and empirical evidence linking the number of Gibbs steps k and the magnitude of the RBM parameters to the bias in the CD estimator. These experiments also suggest that the sign of the CD estimator is correct most of the time, even when the bias is large, so that CD-k is a good descent direction even for small k.},

In aged flies, respiratory activity is compromised and the production of peroxide radicals is increased. In about 50{\%} of mitochondria from old flies, the inner membrane organization breaks down. This establishes a clear link between inner membrane architecture and functional decline.

abstract = {Machine learning methods for protein function prediction are urgently needed, especially now that a substantial fraction of known sequences remains unannotated despite the extensive use of functional assignments based on sequence similarity. One major bottleneck supervised learning faces in protein function prediction is the structured, multi-label nature of the problem, because biological roles are represented by lists of terms from hierarchically organised controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology. In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multitask deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability.},

This hybridization of structural methods, primarily electron microscopy (EM) and X-ray crystallography, but also small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, is central to integrative structural biology. Here, the interplay of X-ray crystallography and EM is illustrated through the example of the structural determination of the marine lipid-containing bacteriophage PM2.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The maturing field of genomics is rapidly increasing the number of sequenced genomes and producing more information from those previously sequenced. Much of this additional information is variation data derived from sampling multiple individuals of a given species with the goal of discovering new variants and characterising the population frequencies of the variants that are already known. These data have immense value for many studies, including those designed to understand evolution and connect genotype to phenotype. Maximising the utility of the data requires that it be stored in an accessible manner that facilitates the integration of variation data with other genome resources such as gene annotation and comparative genomics.

DESCRIPTION: The Ensembl project provides comprehensive and integrated variation resources for a wide variety of chordate genomes. This paper provides a detailed description of the sources of data and the methods for creating the Ensembl variation databases. It also explores the utility of the information by explaining the range of query options available, from using interactive web displays, to online data mining tools and connecting directly to the data servers programmatically. It gives a good overview of the variation resources and future plans for expanding the variation data within Ensembl.

CONCLUSIONS: Variation data is an important key to understanding the functional and phenotypic differences between individuals. The development of new sequencing and genotyping technologies is greatly increasing the amount of variation data known for almost all genomes. The Ensembl variation resources are integrated into the Ensembl genome browser and provide a comprehensive way to access this data in the context of a widely used genome bioinformatics system. All Ensembl data is freely available at http://www.ensembl.org and from the public MySQL database server at ensembldb.ensembl.org.},

The conserved, amino-terminal arginine-rich domain of Nlambda protein is known to interact with a small RNA hairpin (boxB) derived from the nut site RNA. We have examined the binding of Nlambda protein, peptides derived from the amino terminus of Nlambda, and the related phage P22 N protein to lambda boxB RNAs. To facilitate the study of complexes that are not amenable to gel retardation assays, a new polyacrylamide affinity coelectrophoresis technique (PACE) was developed. Using the PACE assay, we have demonstrated that a 19-amino acid peptide from the amino terminus of Nlambda protein binds lambda boxB RNA with a Kd,app of 5.2 nM. PACE was also used to study the binding affinity of a number of Nlambda peptide and lambda boxB RNA mutants. The PACE technique is complementary to the traditional gel retardation assay for direct measurement of binding interactions, and will be useful for any procedure that requires a pool of RNAs to be resolved based on their relative affinities for proteins or peptides.},

abstract = {53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.},

abstract = {Pore-forming proteins insert from solution into membranes to create lesions, undergoing a structural rearrangement often accompanied by oligomerization. Lysenin, a pore-forming toxin from the earthworm Eisenia fetida, specifically interacts with sphingomyelin (SM) and may confer innate immunity against parasites by attacking their membranes to form pores. SM has important roles in cell membranes and lysenin is a popular SM-labeling reagent. The structure of lysenin suggests common ancestry with other pore-forming proteins from a diverse set of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The complex with SM shows the mode of its recognition by a protein in which both the phosphocholine headgroup and one acyl tail are specifically bound. Lipid interaction studies and assays using viable target cells confirm the functional reliance of lysenin on this form of SM recognition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The hereditary disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is associated with striking cellular radiosensitivity that cannot be attributed to the characterized cell cycle checkpoint defects. By epistasis analysis, we show that ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) and Artemis, the protein defective in patients with RS-SCID, function in a common double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway that also requires H2AX, 53BP1, Nbs1, Mre11, and DNA-PK. We show that radiation-induced Artemis hyperphosphorylation is ATM dependent. The DSB repair process requires Artemis nuclease activity and rejoins approximately 10{\%} of radiation-induced DSBs. Our findings are consistent with a model in which ATM is required for Artemis-dependent processing of double-stranded ends with damaged termini. We demonstrate that Artemis is a downstream component of the ATM signaling pathway required uniquely for the DSB repair function but dispensable for ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoint arrest. The significant radiosensitivity of Artemis-deficient cells demonstrates the importance of this component of DSB repair to survival.},

abstract = {Genetic screens in Drosophila have been instrumental in distinguishing approximately 390 loci involved in position effect variegation and heterochromatin stabilization. Most of the identified genes [so-called Su(var) and E(var) genes] are also conserved in mammals, where more than 50 of their gene products are known to localize to constitutive heterochromatin. From these proteins, approximately 12 core heterochromatin components can be inferred. In addition, there are approximately 30 additional Su(var) and 10 E(var) factors that can, under distinct developmental options, interchange with constitutive heterochromatin and participate in the partitioning of the genome into repressed and active chromatin domains. A significant fraction of the Su(var) and E(var) factors are enzymes that respond to environmental and metabolic signals, thereby allowing both the variation and propagation of epigenetic states to a dynamic chromatin template. Moreover, the misregulation of human SU(VAR) and E(VAR) function can advance cancer and many other human diseases including more complex disorders. As such, mammalian Su(var) and E(var) genes and their products provide a rich source of novel targets for diagnosis of and pharmaceutical intervention in many human diseases.},

abstract = {Thiostrepton (TSR), an archetypal bimacrocyclic thiopeptide antibiotic that arises from complex posttranslational modifications of a genetically encoded precursor peptide, possesses a quinaldic acid (QA) moiety within the side-ring system of a thiopeptide-characteristic framework. Focusing on selective engineering of the QA moiety, i.e., by fluorination or methylation, we have recently designed and biosynthesized biologically more active TSR analogs. Using these analogs as chemical probes, we uncovered an unusual indirect mechanism of TSR-type thiopeptides, which are able to act against intracellular pathogens through host autophagy induction in addition to direct targeting of bacterial ribosome. Herein, we report the accumulation of 6′- fluoro-7′, 8′-epoxy-TSR, a key intermediate in the preparation of the analog 6′-fluoro-TSR. This unexpected finding led to unveiling of the TSR maturation process, which involves an unusual dual activity of TsrI, an $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold protein, for cascade C-N bond cleavage and formation during side-ring system construction. These two functions of TsrI rely on the same catalytic triad, Ser72-His200- Asp191, which first mediates endopeptidyl hydrolysis that occurs selectively between the residues Met-1 and Ile1 for removal of the leader peptide and then triggers epoxide ring opening for closure of the QA-containing side-ring system in a regio- And stereo-specific manner. The former reaction likely requires the formation of an acyl-Ser72 enzyme intermediate; in contrast, the latter is independent of Ser72. Consequently, C-6′ fluorination of QA lowers the reactivity of the epoxide intermediate and, thereby, allows the dissection of the TsrI-associated enzymatic process that proceeds rapidly and typically is difficult to be realized during TSR biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard method to determine differential gene expression. Identifying differentially expressed genes crucially depends on estimates of read-count variability. These estimates are typically based on statistical models such as the negative binomial distribution, which is employed by the tools edgeR, DESeq and cuffdiff. Until now, the validity of these models has usually been tested on either low-replicate RNA-seq data or simulations. Results: A 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment in yeast was performed and data tested against theoretical models. The observed gene read counts were consistent with both log-normal and negative binomial distributions, while the mean-variance relation followed the line of constant dispersion parameter of ∼0.01. The high-replicate data also allowed for strict quality control and screening of 'bad' replicates, which can drastically affect the gene read-count distribution.

abstract = {Modular protein domains are functional units that can be modified through the acquisition of new intrinsic activities or by the formation of novel domain combinations, thereby contributing to the evolution of proteins with new biological properties. Here, we assign proteins to groups with related domain compositions and functional properties, termed "domain clubs," which we use to compare multiple eukaryotic proteomes. This analysis shows that different domain types can take distinct evolutionary trajectories, which correlate with the conservation, gain, expansion, or decay of particular biological processes. Evolutionary jumps are associated with a domain that coordinately acquires a new intrinsic function and enters new domain clubs, thereby providing the modified domain with access to a new cellular microenvironment. We also coordinately analyzed the covalent and noncovalent interactions of different domain types to assess the molecular compartment occupied by each domain. This reveals that specific subsets of domains demarcate particular cellular processes, such as growth factor signaling, chromatin remodeling, apoptotic and inflammatory responses, or vesicular trafficking. We suggest that domains, and the proteins in which they reside, are selected during evolution through reciprocal interactions with protein domains in their local microenvironment. Based on this scheme, we propose a mechanism by which Tudor domains may have evolved to support different modes of epigenetic regulation and suggest a role for the germline group of mammalian Tudor domains in Piwi-regulated RNA biology.},

We reveal molecular networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplants and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under the curve = 87{\%}) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the steatosis phenome ({\textgreater}75{\%} shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via microbiome-based therapies.},

The structure explains the formation of a unique heterotrimeric arrangement and reveals significant differences among the three subunits in the sites implicated in binding to the clamp loader and to ligand proteins.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The computational prediction of gene function is a key step in making full use of newly sequenced genomes. Function is generally predicted by transferring annotations from homologous genes or proteins for which experimental evidence exists. The 'ortholog conjecture' proposes that orthologous genes should be preferred when making such predictions, as they evolve functions more slowly than paralogous genes. Previous research has provided little support for the ortholog conjecture, though the incomplete nature of the data cast doubt on the conclusions. RESULTS: We use experimental annotations from over 40 000 proteins, drawn from over 80 000 publications, to revisit the ortholog conjecture in two pairs of species: (i) Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and (ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By making a distinction between questions about the evolution of function versus questions about the prediction of function, we find strong evidence against the ortholog conjecture in the context of function prediction, though questions about the evolution of function remain difficult to address. In both pairs of species, we quantify the amount of information that would be ignored if paralogs are discarded, as well as the resulting loss in prediction accuracy. Taken as a whole, our results support the view that the types of homologs used for function transfer are largely irrelevant to the task of function prediction. Maximizing the amount of data used for this task, regardless of whether it comes from orthologs or paralogs, is most likely to lead to higher prediction accuracy.

The non-protein component of the amyloid (aluminum silicate) may form the basis for the deposition or amplification (possible self-replication) of the aggregated amyloid protein.

abstract = {Background: Protein evolution gives rise to families of structurally related proteins, within which sequence identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated relationships in known structures and in optimal cases function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast evaluation of protein structures. Results: We present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four main levels of our classification are protein class (C), architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is considered, such that members of the same architecture might nave quite different topologies. When structures belonging to the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous superfamily. Conclusions: Analysis of the structural families generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A database of well-characterised protein structure families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of structure-function/evolution relationships to both known and newly determined protein structures.},

Their gating is sensitive to polyunsaturated fatty acids, mechanical deformation of the membrane, and temperature changes. Physiologically, these channels appear to control the noxious input threshold for temperature and pressure sensitivity in dorsal root ganglia neurons. We present the crystal structure of human TRAAK at a resolution of 3.8 angstroms. The channel comprises two protomers, each containing two distinct pore domains, which create a two-fold symmetric K(+) channel. The extracellular surface features a helical cap, 35 angstroms tall, that creates a bifurcated pore entryway and accounts for the insensitivity of two-pore domain K(+) channels to inhibitory toxins. Two diagonally opposed gate-forming inner helices form membrane-interacting structures that may underlie this channel's sensitivity to chemical and mechanical properties of the cell membrane.},

abstract = {Background Many unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. In budding yeast, asymmetric segregation of cellular damage results in aging mother cells and rejuvenated daughters. We hypothesize that the organisms in which this asymmetry is lacking, or can be modulated, may not undergo aging. Results We performed a complete pedigree analysis of microcolonies of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe growing from a single cell. When cells were grown under favorable conditions, none of the lineages exhibited aging, which is defined as a consecutive increase in division time and increased death probability. Under favorable conditions, few cells died, and their death was random and sudden rather than following a gradual increase in division time. Cell death correlated with the inheritance of Hsp104-associated protein aggregates. After stress, the cells that inherited large aggregates aged, showing a consecutive increase in division time and an increased death probability. Their sisters, who inherited little or no aggregates, did not age. Conclusions We conclude that S. pombe does not age under favorable growth conditions, but does so under stress. This transition appears to be passive rather than active and results from the formation of a single large aggregate, which segregates asymmetrically at the subsequent cell division. We argue that this damage-induced asymmetric segregation has evolved to sacrifice some cells so that others may survive unscathed after severe environmental stresses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is an ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve the computational annotation of protein function. Results: Here, we report on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms of volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed. In a novel and major new development, computational predictions and assessment goals drove some of the experimental assays, resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000 genes. Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes, which provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes associated with biofilm formation and motility. We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in Drosophila melanogaster, which we suspected of being involved in long-Term memory. Conclusion: We conclude that while predictions of the molecular function and biological process annotations have slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component have not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations remains equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods is significantly better than the expectations set by baseline methods in C. albicans and D. melanogaster, it leaves considerable room and need for improvement. Finally, we report that the CAFA community now involves a broad range of participants with expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation, biocuration, and bio-ontologies, working together to improve functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our ability to manage big data in the era of large experimental screens.},

Analysis of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data in humans and mice revealed four specific post-translational histone modifications enriched in exons. Our findings indicate that previously described enrichment of H3K36me3 modifications in exons reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, namely increased nucleosome occupancy along exons.

The cal gene was located on the ColA plasmid map adjacent to cai, the gene coding for colicin A immunity protein, and therefore 592 bases downstream from caa, the structural gene for colicin A. Transcription of cal is in the same direction as caa, that is in the opposite direction to cai. Its sequence has been determined and the predicted amino acid composition features a basic N-terminal end followed by a serie of hydrophobic residues similar to the signal sequence in precursors of exported proteins. The C-terminal part also contains a core of hydrophobic residues. The overall amino acid sequence of the cal protein is homologous to that of lytic proteins encoded by the related plasmids pColE1, and pCloDF13. The cal protein has been identified on urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gels by selective labelling with various radioactive amino acids and its synthesis is co-induced with that of colicin A. The cal protein undergoes slow processing with loss of the N-terminal "signal" region and the mature form is released into the medium together with colicin A.},

It is becoming clear that alternative splicing has an extremely important role in expanding protein diversity and might therefore partially underlie the apparent discrepancy between gene number and organismal complexity. Alternative splicing can generate more transcripts from a single gene than the number of genes in an entire genome. However, for the vast majority of alternative splicing events, the functional significance is unknown.

abstract = {One of the surprising findings of the Human Genome Project was that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which, by definition, have a minor allele frequency greater than 1{\%}, occur at higher rates than previously suspected. When occurring in the gene coding regions, SNPs can be synonymous (i.e., not causing a change in the amino acid) or nonsynonymous (when the amino acid is altered). It has long been assumed that synonymous SNPs are inconsequential, as the primary sequence of the protein is retained. A number of studies have questioned this assumption over the last decade, showing that synonymous mutations are also under evolutionary pressure and they can be implicated in disease. More importantly, several of the mechanisms by which synonymous mutations alter the structure, function, and expression level of proteins are now being elucidated. Studies have demonstrated that synonymous polymorphisms can affect messenger RNA splicing, stability, and structure as well as protein folding. These changes can have a significant effect on the function of proteins, change cellular response to therapeutic targets, and often explain the different responses of individual patients to a certain medication.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes containing histone variant H2A.Z (Htz1) serve to poise quiescent genes for activation and transcriptional initiation. However, little is known about their role in transcription elongation. Here we show that dominant mutations in the elongation genes SPT5 and SPT16 suppress the hypersensitivity of htz1$\Delta$ strains to drugs that inhibit elongation, indicating that Htz1 functions at the level of transcription elongation. Direct kinetic measurements of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) movement across the 9.5-kb GAL10p-VPS13 gene revealed that the elongation rate of polymerase is 24{\%} slower in the absence of Htz1. We provide evidence for two nonexclusive mechanisms. First, we observed that both the phospho-Ser2 levels in the elongating isoform of Pol II and the loading of Spt5 and Elongator over the GAL1 open reading frame (ORF) depend on Htz1. Second, in the absence of Htz1, the density of nucleosome occupancy is increased over the GAL10p-VPS13 ORF and the chromatin is refractory to remodeling during active transcription. These results establish a mechanistic role for Htz1 in transcription elongation and suggest that Htz1-containing nucleosomes facilitate Pol II passage by affecting the correct assembly and modification status of Pol II elongation complexes and by favoring efficient nucleosome remodeling over the gene.},

Currently, it connects human phenotype and clinical data in various locus-specific databases (LSDBs) with data on genome sequences, evolutionary history, and function from the ENCODE project and other resources in the UCSC Genome Browser. Initially, we focused on a few selected LSDBs covering genes encoding alpha- and beta-globins (HBA, HBB), phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), blood group antigens (various genes), androgen receptor (AR), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), but we plan to include additional loci of clinical importance, ultimately genomewide. We have also imported variant data and associated OMIM links from Swiss-Prot. Users can find interesting mutations in the UCSC Genome Browser (in a new Locus Variants track) and follow links back to the LSDBs for more detailed information. Alternatively, they can start with queries on mutations or phenotypes at an LSDB and then display the results at the Genome Browser to view complementary information such as functional data (e.g., chromatin modifications and protein binding from the ENCODE consortium), evolutionary constraint, regulatory potential, and/or any other tracks they choose. We present several examples illustrating the power of these connections for exploring phenotypes associated with functional elements, and for identifying genomic data that could help to explain clinical phenotypes.},

abstract = {Caffeine potentiates the lethal effects of ultraviolet and ionising radiation on wild-type Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. In previous studies this was attributed to the inhibition by caffeine of a novel DNA repair pathway in S. pombe that was absent in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Studies with radiation-sensitive S. pombe mutants suggested that this caffeine-sensitive pathway could repair ultraviolet radiation damage in the absence of nucleotide excision repair. The alternative pathway was thought to be recombinational and to operate in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. However, in this study we show that cells held in G1 of the cell cycle can remove ultraviolet-induced lesions in the absence of nucleotide excision repair. We also show that recombination-defective mutants, and those now known to define the alternative repair pathway, still exhibit the caffeine effect. Our observations suggest that the basis of the caffeine effect is not due to direct inhibition of recombinational repair. The mutants originally thought to be involved in a caffeine-sensitive recombinational repair process are now known to be defective in arresting the cell cycle in S and/or G2 following DNA damage or incomplete replication. The gene products may also have an additional role in a DNA repair or damage tolerance pathway. The effect of caffeine could, therefore, be due to interference with DNA damage checkpoints, or inhibition of the DNA damage repair/tolerance pathway. Using a combination of flow cytometric analysis, mitotic index analysis and fluorescence microscopy we show that caffeine interferes with intra-S phase and G2 DNA damage checkpoints, overcoming cell cycle delays associated with damaged DNA. In contrast, caffeine has no effect on the DNA replication S phase checkpoint in reponse to inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea.},

abstract = {Type 1 pili are the archetypal representative of a widespread class of adhesive multisubunit fibres in Gram-negative bacteria. During pilus assembly, subunits dock as chaperone-bound complexes to an usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus translocation across the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length FimD usher bound to the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex and that of the unbound form of the FimD translocation domain. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure shows FimH inserted inside the FimD 24-stranded $\beta$-barrel translocation channel. FimC-FimH is held in place through interactions with the two carboxy-terminal periplasmic domains of FimD, a binding mode confirmed in solution by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To accommodate FimH, the usher plug domain is displaced from the barrel lumen to the periplasm, concomitant with a marked conformational change in the $\beta$-barrel. The amino-terminal domain of FimD is observed in an ideal position to catalyse incorporation of a newly recruited chaperone-subunit complex. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure provides unique insights into the pilus subunit incorporation cycle, and captures the first view of a protein transporter in the act of secreting its cognate substrate.},

abstract = {The role of polysaccharides in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is unclear. However, in light of studies indicating impaired glucose utilization in AD and increased activation of the hexosamine pathway that is seen with hyperglycemia, in the brains of patients with AD, aberrantly high levels of glucosamine may result in synthesis of glucosamine polymers such as chitin, a highly insoluble polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine, linearized by beta1-4 linkages. To examine this further, we studied brain tissue at autopsy from subjects with sporadic and familial AD using calcofluor histochemistry. Calcofluor excites on exposure to ultraviolet light and exhibits a high affinity for chitin in vivo by interacting with beta1-4 linkages. Amyloid plaques and blood vessels affected by amyloid angiopathy showed bright fluorescence. Moreover, treatment with chitinase, followed by beta-N-acetyl glucosaminidase showed a decrease in calcofluor fluorescence. Since chitin is a highly insoluble molecule and a substrate for glycan-protein interactions, chitin-like polysaccharides within the brain could facilitate nucleation of amyloid proteins in various amyloidoses including AD.},

abstract = {Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), which controls growth in response to nutrients, promotes ageing in multiple organisms. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe emerges as a valuable genetic model system to study TORC1 function and cellular ageing. Here we exploited the combinatorial action of rapamycin and caffeine, which inhibit fission yeast growth in a TORC1-dependent manner. We screened a deletion library, comprising ∼84{\%} of all non-essential fission yeast genes, for drug-resistant mutants. This screen identified 33 genes encoding functions such as transcription, kinases, mitochondrial respiration, biosynthesis, intra-cellular trafficking, and stress response. Among the corresponding mutants, 5 showed shortened and 21 showed increased maximal chronological lifespans; 15 of the latter mutants showed no further lifespan increase with rapamycin and might thus represent key targets downstream of TORC1. We pursued the long-lived sck2 mutant with additional functional analyses, revealing that the Sck2p kinase functions within the TORC1 network and is required for normal cell growth, global protein translation, and ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation in a nutrient-dependent manner. Notably, slow cell growth was associated with all long-lived mutants while oxidative-stress resistance was not.},

abstract = {Most eukaryotic proteins are multi-domain proteins that are created from fusions of genes, deletions and internal repetitions. An investigation of such evolutionary events requires a method to find the domain architecture from which each protein originates. Therefore, we defined a novel measure, domain distance, which is calculated as the number of domains that differ between two domain architectures. Using this measure the evolutionary events that distinguish a protein from its closest ancestor have been studied and it was found that indels are more common than internal repetition and that the exchange of a domain is rare. Indels and repetitions are common at both the N and C-terminals while they are rare between domains. The evolution of the majority of multi-domain proteins can be explained by the stepwise insertions of single domains, with the exception of repeats that sometimes are duplicated several domains in tandem. We show that domain distances agree with sequence similarity and semantic similarity based on gene ontology annotations. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the domain distance measure to build evolutionary trees. Finally, the evolution of multi-domain proteins is exemplified by a closer study of the evolution of two protein families, non-receptor tyrosine kinases and RhoGEFs. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The ability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) to undergo conformational transitions is exquisitely sensitive to its surrounding lipid environment. Previous work has highlighted a conformational selection mechanism, whereby different lipids stabilize different proportions of activatable resting versus nonactivatable conformations. In the absence of anionic lipids and cholesterol, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation, which binds agonist with resting state-like affinity but does not usually undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. Very slow (minutes to hours) transitions from uncoupled to coupled (resting, open and/or desensitized) conformations, however, can occur in membranes with relatively thick hydrophobic cores. Increasing membrane hydrophobic thickness 'awakens' uncoupled nAChRs by reducing the large activation energy barrier (or barriers) leading to coupled states, thus allowing conformational transitions to occur on an experimentally tractable timescale. Lipids shape activity by modulating the relative proportions of activatable versus nonactivatable conformations and by controlling the transitions between uncoupled and coupled conformations.},

abstract = {A systems-level understanding of biological processes and information flow requires the mapping of cellular component interactions, among which protein-protein interactions are particularly important. Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is a valuable model organism for which no systematic protein-interaction data are available. We exploited gene and protein properties, global genome regulation datasets, and conservation of interactions between budding and fission yeast to predict fission yeast protein interactions in silico. We have extensively tested our method in three ways: first, by predicting with 70-80{\%} accuracy a selected high-confidence test set; second, by recapitulating interactions between members of the well-characterized SAGA co-activator complex; and third, by verifying predicted interactions of the Cbf11 transcription factor using mass spectrometry of TAP-purified protein complexes. Given the importance of the pathway in cell physiology and human disease, we explore the predicted sub-networks centered on the Tor1/2 kinases. Moreover, we predict the histidine kinases Mak1/2/3 to be vital hubs in the fission yeast stress response network, and we suggest interactors of argonaute 1, the principal component of the siRNA-mediated gene silencing pathway, lost in budding yeast but preserved in S. pombe. Of the new high-quality interactions that were discovered after we started this work, 73{\%} were found in our predictions. Even though any predicted interactome is imperfect, the protein network presented here can provide a valuable basis to explore biological processes and to guide wet-lab experiments in fission yeast and beyond. Our predicted protein interactions are freely available through PInt, an online resource on our website (www.bahlerlab.info/PInt).},

abstract = {Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) rapidly produce effector cytokines. In this study, we report the first crystal structures of the iNKT cell T cell receptor (TCR) bound to two natural, microbial glycolipids presented by CD1d. Binding of the TCR induced CDR3-$\alpha$-dependent structural changes in the F' roof of CD1d; these changes resemble those occurring in the absence of TCR engagement when the highly potent synthetic antigen $\alpha$-galactosylceramide ($\alpha$-GalCer) binds CD1d. Furthermore, in the Borrelia burgdorferi $\alpha$-galactosyl diacylglycerol-CD1d complex, TCR binding caused a marked repositioning of the galactose sugar into an orientation that closely resembles $\alpha$-GalCer. The TCR-dependent reorientation of the sugar, together with the induced CD1d fit, may explain the weaker potency of the microbial antigens compared with $\alpha$-GalCer. We propose that the TCR of iNKT cells binds with a conserved footprint onto CD1d, regardless of the bound glycolipid antigen, and that for microbial antigens this unique binding mode requires TCR-initiated conformational changes.},

Numerous mutations in RyRs have been associated with human diseases. The molecular mechanism underlying the complex regulation of RyRs is poorly understood. Using electron cryomicroscopy, here we determine the architecture of rabbit RyR1 at a resolution of 6.1 {\AA}. We show that the cytoplasmic moiety of RyR1 contains two large $\alpha$-solenoid domains and several smaller domains, with folds suggestive of participation in protein-protein interactions. The transmembrane domain represents a chimaera of voltage-gated sodium and pH-activated ion channels.

@article{Butterfield2014,
abstract = {Accumulation of oxidative damage is a common feature of neurodegeneration that, together with mitochondrial dysfunction, point to the fact that reactive oxygen species are major contributors to loss of neuronal homoeostasis and cell death. Among several targets of oxidative stress, free-radical-mediated damage to proteins is particularly important in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In the majority of cases, oxidative-stress-mediated post-translational modifications cause non-reversible modifications of protein structure that consistently lead to impaired function. Redox proteomics methods are powerful tools to unravel the complexity of neurodegeneration, by identifying brain proteins with oxidative post-translational modifications that are detrimental for protein function. The present review discusses the current literature showing evidence of impaired pathways linked to oxidative stress possibly involved in the neurodegenerative process leading to the development of Alzheimer-like dementia. In particular, we focus attention on dysregulated pathways that underlie neurodegeneration in both aging adults with DS (Down's syndrome) and AD (Alzheimer's disease). Since AD pathology is age-dependent in DS and shows similarities with AD, identification of common oxidized proteins by redox proteomics in both DS and AD can improve our understanding of the overlapping mechanisms that lead from normal aging to development of AD. The most relevant proteomics findings highlight that disturbance of protein homoeostasis and energy production are central mechanisms of neurodegeneration and overlap in aging DS and AD. Protein oxidation affects crucial intracellular functions and may be considered a 'leitmotif' of degenerating neurons. Therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing/reducing multiple components of processes leading to accumulation of oxidative damage will be critical in future studies.},

abstract = {Age is the greatest risk factor for nearly every major cause of mortality in developed nations. Despite this, most biomedical research focuses on individual disease processes without much consideration for the relationships between aging and disease. Recent discoveries in the field of geroscience, which aims to explain biological mechanisms of aging, have provided insights into molecular processes that underlie biological aging and, perhaps more importantly, potential interventions to delay aging and promote healthy longevity. Here we describe some of these advances, along with efforts to move geroscience from the bench to the clinic. We also propose that greater emphasis should be placed on research into basic aging processes, because interventions that slow aging will have a greater effect on quality of life compared with disease-specific approaches.},

Distal enhancer elements are key drivers of spatiotemporal specificity in gene regulation. Often located tens of kilobases from their target promoters and functioning in an orientation-independent manner, the identification of bona fide enhancers has proved a formidable challenge. With the development of ChIP-seq, global cataloging of putative enhancers has become feasible. Here, we review the current understanding of the chromatin landscape at enhancers and how these chromatin features enable robust identification of tissue-specific enhancers.},

abstract = {The ATR-dependent DNA damage response pathway can respond to a diverse group of lesions as well as inhibitors of DNA replication. Using the Xenopus egg extract system, we show that lesions induced by UV irradiation and cis-platinum cause the functional uncoupling of MCM helicase and DNA polymerase activities, an event previously shown for aphidicolin. Inhibition of uncoupling during elongation with inhibitors of MCM7 or Cdc45, a putative helicase cofactor, results in abrogation of Chk1 phosphorylation, indicating that uncoupling is necessary for activation of the checkpoint. However, uncoupling is not sufficient for checkpoint activation, and DNA synthesis by Polalpha is also required. Finally, using plasmids of varying size, we demonstrate that all of the unwound DNA generated at a stalled replication fork can contribute to the level of Chk1 phosphorylation, suggesting that uncoupling amplifies checkpoint signaling at each individual replication fork. Taken together, these observations indicate that functional uncoupling of MCM helicase and DNA polymerase activities occurs in response to multiple forms of DNA damage and that there is a general mechanism for generation of the checkpoint-activating signal following DNA damage.},

abstract = {Presynaptic CaV2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, initiate synaptic transmission at most synapses in the central nervous system. Regulation of CaV2.1 channels by CaM contributes significantly to short-term facilitation and rapid depression of synaptic transmission. Short-term synaptic plasticity is diverse in form and function at different synapses, yet CaM is ubiquitously expressed. Differential regulation of CaV2.1 channels by CaM-like Ca2+ sensor (CaS) proteins differentially affects short-term synaptic facilitation and rapid synaptic depression in transfected sympathetic neuron synapses. Here we define the molecular determinants for differential regulation of CaV2.1 channels by the CaS protein CaBP1 by analysis of chimeras in which the unique structural domains of CaBP1 are inserted into CaM. Our results show that the N-terminal domain, including its myristoylation site, and the second EF-hand, which is inactive in Ca2+ binding, are the key molecular determinants of differential regulation of CaV2.1 channels by CaBP1. These findings give insight into the molecular code by which CaS proteins differentially regulate CaV2.1 channel function and provide diversity of form and function of short-term synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Motivation Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used to annotate functions of proteins and understand their biological roles. Currently only {\textless}1{\%} of {\textgreater}70 million proteins in UniProtKB have experimental GO annotations, implying the strong necessity of automated function prediction (AFP) of proteins, where AFP is a hard multilabel classification problem due to one protein with a diverse number of GO terms. Most of these proteins have only sequences as input information, indicating the importance of sequence-based AFP (SAFP: sequences are the only input). Furthermore, homology-based SAFP tools are competitive in AFP competitions, while they do not necessarily work well for so-called difficult proteins, which have {\textless}60{\%} sequence identity to proteins with annotations already. Thus, the vital and challenging problem now is how to develop a method for SAFP, particularly for difficult proteins. Methods The key of this method is to extract not only homology information but also diverse, deep-rooted information/evidence from sequence inputs and integrate them into a predictor in a both effective and efficient manner. We propose GOLabeler, which integrates five component classifiers, trained from different features, including GO term frequency, sequence alignment, amino acid trigram, domains and motifs, and biophysical properties, etc., in the framework of learning to rank (LTR), a paradigm of machine learning, especially powerful for multilabel classification. Results The empirical results obtained by examining GOLabeler extensively and thoroughly by using large-scale datasets revealed numerous favorable aspects of GOLabeler, including significant performance advantage over state-of-the-art AFP methods.

abstract = {Partial proteolytic digestion of colicin A with bromelain allowed the isolation of a 20-kd fragment. This fragment has been purified to homogeneity and its molecular properties have been studied. The sequence of the 54 N-terminal amino acid residues has been determined by automated Edman degradation. This sequence is identical to that of the predicted amino acid sequence of the 20-kd C-terminal part of the colicin A polypeptide deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the caa gene. This polypeptide can produce channels in phospholipid planar bilayers of the same size as those formed by colicin A. However, the voltage-dependence for opening and closing was drastically altered in the peptide fragment channels. The latter, in contrast to colicin A channels, remained open over a wide range of voltage. Large negative potentials were required to close the peptide fragment channels although opening took place in the same voltage range as for colicin A ionic pores.},

The crystal structure of Orai from Drosophila melanogaster, determined at 3.35 angstrom resolution, reveals that the calcium channel is composed of a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore. The pore traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs markedly from other ion channels and gives insight into the principles of selective calcium permeation and gating.},

Variability of coupling may occur under some conditions but is generally not significant. The fractional values result from the coupling ratios of proton transport.

abstract = {BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, and mutations in these genes predispose to breast and other cancers. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks. We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.},

abstract = {In dense plant populations, individuals shade each other resulting in a low-light habitat that is enriched in far-red light. This light quality gradient decreases the efficiency of the photosynthetic light reaction as a result of imbalanced excitation of the two photosystems. Plants counteract such conditions by performing acclimation reactions. Two major mechanisms are known to assure efficient photosynthesis: state transitions, which act on a short-term timescale; and a long-term response, which enables the plant to re-adjust photosystem stoichiometry in favour of the rate-limiting photosystem. Both processes start with the perception of the imbalanced photosystem excitation via reduction/oxidation (redox) signals from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Recent data in Arabidopsis indicate that initialization of the molecular processes in both cases involve the activity of the thylakoid membrane-associated kinase, STN7. Thus, redox-controlled phosphorylation events may not only adjust photosystem antenna structure but may also affect plastid, as well as nuclear, gene expression. Both state transitions and the long-term response have been described mainly in molecular terms, while the physiological relevance concerning plant survival and reproduction has been poorly investigated. Recent studies have shed more light on this topic. Here, we give an overview on the long-term response, its physiological effects, possible mechanisms and its relationship to state transitions as well as to nonphotochemical quenching, another important short-term mechanism that mediates high-light acclimation. Special emphasis is given to the functional roles and potential interactions between the different light acclimation strategies. A working model displays the various responses as an integrated molecular system that helps plants to acclimate to the changing light environment.},

abstract = {Gene networks are rapidly growing in size and number, raising the question of which networks are most appropriate for particular applications. Here, we evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets identified through literature curation, gene expression profiling, or genome-wide association studies. While all networks have some ability to recover disease genes, we observe a wide range of performance with STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks having the best performance overall. A general tendency is that performance scales with network size, suggesting that new interaction discovery currently outweighs the detrimental effects of false positives. Correcting for size, we find that the DIP network provides the highest efficiency (value per interaction). Based on these results, we create a parsimonious composite network with both high efficiency and performance. This work provides a benchmark for selection of molecular networks in human disease research.},

Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work addresses these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques, and application scenarios.},

abstract = {Background: Oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelin are critical for normal brain function and have been implicated in neurodegeneration. Several lines of evidence including neuroimaging and neuropathological data suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be associated with dysmyelination and a breakdown of OL-axon communication. Methods: In order to understand this phenomenon on a molecular level, we systematically interrogated OL-enriched gene networks constructed from large-scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from human AD postmortem brain samples. We then validated these networks using gene expression datasets generated from mice with ablation of major gene expression nodes identified in our AD-dysregulated networks. Results: The robust OL gene coexpression networks that we identified were highly enriched for genes associated with AD risk variants, such as BIN1 and demonstrated strong dysregulation in AD. We further corroborated the structure of the corresponding gene causal networks using datasets generated from the brain of mice with ablation of key network drivers, such as UGT8, CNP and PLP1, which were identified from human AD brain data. Further, we found that mice with genetic ablations of Cnp mimicked aspects of myelin and mitochondrial gene expression dysregulation seen in brain samples from patients with AD, including decreased protein expression of BIN1 and GOT2. Conclusions: This study provides a molecular blueprint of the dysregulation of gene expression networks of OL in AD and identifies key OL- and myelination-related genes and networks that are highly associated with AD.},

More recently, investigators have begun to interrogate the other yeasts, the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, to determine if similar longevity and cell death pathways exist in these organisms. After summarizing the longevity and cell death phenotypes in S. cerevisiae, this mini-review surveys the progress made in the study of both aging and programed cell death (PCD) in the yeast models, with a focus on the biology of S. pombe and C. albicans. Particular emphasis is placed on the similarities and differences between the two types of aging, replicative aging, and chronological aging, and between the three types of cell death, intrinsic apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and regulated necrosis, found in these yeasts. The development of the additional microbial models for aging and PCD in the other yeasts may help further elucidate the mechanisms of longevity and cell death regulation in eukaryotes.},

The database is viewed as a graph where elements are represented as nodes and relations as links between nodes. From this graph, seven kernels are computed, leading to a set of meaningful proximity measures between nodes, allowing to answer questions about the structure of the graph under investigation; in particular, recommend items to users. Cross- validation results indicate that a simple nearest-neighbours rule based on the similarity measure provided by the regularized Laplacian, the Markov diffusion and the commute time kernels performs best. We therefore recommend the use of the commute time kernel for computing similarities between elements of a database, for two reasons: (1) it has a nice appealing interpretation in terms of random walks and (2) no parameter needs to be adjusted.},

abstract = {The 16S rRNA gene provides insufficient information to infer the range of chloroorganic electron acceptors used by different Dehalococcoides organisms. To overcome this limitation and provide enhanced diagnostic tools for growth measurements, site assessment, and bioremediation monitoring, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approach targeting 16S rRNA genes and three Dehalococcoides reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes with assigned function (i.e., tceA, bvcA, and vcrA) was designed and evaluated. qPCR standard curves generated for the RDase genes by use of genomic DNA from Dehalococcoides pure cultures correlated with standard curves obtained for both Bacteria- and Dehalococcoides-targeted 16S rRNA genes, suggesting that the RDase genes are useful targets for quantitative assessment of Dehalococcoides organisms. RDase gene probe/primer pairs were specific for the Dehalococcoides strains known to carry the diagnostic RDase gene sequences, and the qPCR method allowed the detection of as few as 1 to 20 and quantification of as few as 50 to 100 tceA, bvcA, or vcrA gene targets per PCR volume. The qPCR approach was applied to dechlorinating enrichment cultures, microcosms, and samples from a contaminated site. In characterized enrichment cultures where known Dehalococcoides strains were enumerated, the sum of the three RDase genes equaled the total Dehalococcoides cell numbers. In site samples and chloroethane-dechlorinating microcosms, the sum of the three RDase genes was much less than that predicted by Dehalococcoides-targeted qPCR, totaling 10 to 30{\%} of the total Dehalococcoides cell numbers. Hence, a large number of Dehalococcoides spp. contain as-yet-unidentified RDase genes, indicating that our current understanding of the dechlorinating Dehalococcoides community is incomplete.},

abstract = {Most human somatic cells can undergo only a limited number of population doublings in vitro. This exhaustion of proliferative potential, called senescence, can be triggered when telomeres--the ends of linear chromosomes-cannot fulfil their normal protective functions. Here we show that senescent human fibroblasts display molecular markers characteristic of cells bearing DNA double-strand breaks. These markers include nuclear foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX and their co-localization with DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint factors such as 53BP1, MDC1 and NBS1. We also show that senescent cells contain activated forms of the DNA damage checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2. Furthermore, by chromatin immunoprecipitation and whole-genome scanning approaches, we show that the chromosome ends of senescent cells directly contribute to the DNA damage response, and that uncapped telomeres directly associate with many, but not all, DNA damage response proteins. Finally, we show that inactivation of DNA damage checkpoint kinases in senescent cells can restore cell-cycle progression into S phase. Thus, we propose that telomere-initiated senescence reflects a DNA damage checkpoint response that is activated with a direct contribution from dysfunctional telomeres.},

Unprecedented chemical detail is observed for both the ribosome-Sec61 interaction and the conformational state of Sec61 upon ribosome binding.

Whereas methylation of histone H3 on lysines 4, 36, and 79 has been linked with gene activation, methylation of H3 on lysines 9 and 27 and histone H4 on lysine 20 is associated with heterochromatin and some repressed genes within euchromatin. Here, we show that H3K9 di- and trimethylation occur in the transcribed region of active genes in mammalian chromatin. This modification is dynamic, as it increases during activation of transcription and is rapidly removed upon gene repression. Heterochromatin Protein 1gamma (HP1gamma), a protein containing a chromo-domain that recognizes H3K9 methylation, is also present in the transcribed region of all active genes examined. Both the presence of HP1gamma and H3K9 methylation are dependent upon elongation by RNA polymerase II. These findings demonstrate novel roles for H3K9 methylation and HP1gamma in transcription activation.},

Although H2AX deficiency is not detrimental to life, H2AX is required for the accumulation of numerous essential proteins into irradiation induced foci (IRIF). However, the relationship between IRIF formation, H2AX phosphorylation (gamma-H2AX) and the detection of DNA damage is unclear. Here, we show that the migration of repair and signalling proteins to DSBs is not abrogated in H2AX(-/-) cells, or in H2AX-deficient cells that have been reconstituted with H2AX mutants that eliminate phosphorylation. Despite their initial recruitment to DSBs, numerous factors, including Nbs1, 53BP1 and Brca1, subsequently fail to form IRIF. We propose that gamma-H2AX does not constitute the primary signal required for the redistribution of repair complexes to damaged chromatin, but may function to concentrate proteins in the vicinity of DNA lesions. The differential requirements for factor recruitment to DSBs and sequestration into IRIF may explain why essential regulatory pathways controlling the ability of cells to respond to DNA damage are not abolished in the absence of H2AX.},

abstract = {A set of 43 337 splice junction pairs was extracted from mammalian GenBank annotated genes. Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences support 22 489 of them. Of these, 98.71{\%} contain canonical dinucleotides GT and AG for donor and acceptor sites, respectively; 0.56{\%} hold non-canonical GC-AG splice site pairs; and the remaining 0.73{\%} occurs in a lot of small groups (with a maximum size of 0.05{\%}). Studying these groups we observe that many of them contain splicing dinucleotides shifted from the annotated splice junction by one position. After close examination of such cases we present a new classification consisting of only eight observed types of splice site pairs (out of 256 a priori possible combinations). EST alignments allow us to verify the exonic part of the splice sites, but many non-canonical cases may be due to intron sequencing errors. This idea is given substantial support when we compare the sequences of human genes having non-canonical splice sites deposited in GenBank by high throughput genome sequencing projects (HTG). A high proportion (156 out of 171) of the human non-canonical and EST-supported splice site sequences had a clear match in the human HTG. They can be classified after corrections as: 79 GC-AG pairs (of which one was an error that corrected to GC-AG), 61 errors that were corrected to GT-AG canonical pairs, six AT-AC pairs (of which two were errors that corrected to AT-AC), one case was produced from non-existent intron, seven cases were found in HTG that were deposited to GenBank and finally there were only two cases left of supported non-canonical splice sites. If we assume that approximately the same situation is true for the whole set of annotated mammalian non-canonical splice sites, then the 99.24{\%} of splice site pairs should be GT-AG, 0.69{\%} GC-AG, 0.05{\%} AT-AC and finally only 0.02{\%} could consist of other types of non-canonical splice sites. We analyze several characteristics of EST-verified splice sites and build weight matrices for the major groups, which can be incorporated into gene prediction programs. We also present a set of EST-verified canonical splice sites larger by two orders of magnitude than the current one (22 199 entries versus approximately 600) and finally, a set of 290 EST-supported non-canonical splice sites. Both sets should be significant for future investigations of the splicing mechanism.},

abstract = {HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for 20-30{\%} of all breast cancers and has the second-poorest prognosis among breast cancer subtypes. The approval of trastuzumab in 1998 has significantly improved patients' outcomes and paved the way for the beginning of advent of targeted approaches in breast cancer treatment. However, primary or acquired resistance to trastuzumab has been increasingly recognized as a major obstacle in the clinical management of this disease. In addition, in clinical practice, there are currently no conclusive biomarkers for patient response to trastuzumab. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of trastuzumab and the development of resistance to this drug are of interest. Such understanding will provide the guidance critically needed for the design of better combination therapy and will allow the appropriate selection of patients who are responsive to trastuzumab-based strategies. In line with that, our review highlights the well-accepted mechanisms of action and resistance to the therapy and discusses the progress that has been made toward successfully overcoming this resistance.},

@article{Wu1997,
abstract = {In self-fertile strains of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, nitrogen starvation initiates a program of sexual development in which cells express mating pheromones and receptors, arrest cell cycle progression in G1, and conjugate. This process is dependent on Rum1, an inhibitor of the Cdc2-Cdc13 and Cdc2-Cig2 cyclin B kinases. The M-phase induction activity of Cdc2-Cdc13 is inhibited by Wee1 tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates Cdc2 on tyrosine-15. We report here that Wee1 activity is also important for mating. This discovery arose from studies of Nim1, a kinase which promotes mitosis by inhibiting Wee1. Nim1 was previously thought to have an important role in promoting mitosis during nitrogen starvation, but our studies revealed that Nim1 protein drops to an undetectable level within 15 min of nitrogen depletion. In contrast, Wee1 remains abundant, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cdc2 is detected for at least 4 h after resuspension of cells in nitrogen-free medium. This suggested that maintenance of Wee1 activity may be important during the early stages of nitrogen starvation, a proposal confirmed by the observation that mating efficiency is reduced ca. fivefold in wee1- cells. Transcriptional induction of genes encoding mating factors and receptors is also delayed in wee1- cells. The wee1- mating defect is suppressed by deletion of cig2+, which encodes a B-type cyclin that promotes the onset of S and inhibits conjugation. These findings indicate that Wee1 and Rum1 act jointly to inhibit Cdc2 and promote sexual development in nitrogen-starved cells.},

abstract = {CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells bear characteristics of innate and adaptive lymphocytes, which allow them to bridge the two halves of the immune response and play roles in many disease settings. Recent work has characterized precisely how their activation is initiated and regulated. Novel antigens from important pathogens have been identified, as has an abundant self-antigen, $\beta$-glucopyranosylcaramide, capable of mediating an iNKT-cell response. Studies of the iNKT T-cell receptor (TCR)-antigen-CD1d complex show how docking between CD1d-antigen and iNKT TCR is highly conserved, and how small sequence differences in the TCR establish intrinsic variation in iNKT TCR affinity. The sequence of the TCR CDR3$\beta$ loop determines iNKT TCR affinity for ligand-CD1d, independent of ligand identity. CD1d ligands can promote T helper type 1 (Th1) or Th2 biased cytokine responses, depending on the composition of their lipid tails. Ligands loaded into CD1d on the cell surface promote Th2 responses, whereas ligands with long hydrophobic tails are loaded endosomally and promote Th1 responses. This information is informing the design of synthetic iNKT-cell antigens. The iNKT cells may be activated by exogenous antigen, or by a combination of dendritic cell-derived interleukin-12 and iNKT TCR-self-antigen-CD1d engagement. The iNKT-cell activation is further modulated by recent foreign or self-antigen encounter. Activation of dendritic cells through pattern recognition receptors alters their antigen presentation and cytokine production, strongly influencing iNKT-cell activation. In a range of bacterial infections, dendritic cell-dependent innate activation of iNKT cells through interleukin-12 is the dominant influence on their activity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Prolmmune Ltd.

In leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), the absence or inability of $\beta$(2) integrins to undergo affinity upregulation contributes to recurrent infectious episodes and impaired wound healing, while excessive integrin activity leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response with associated tissue damage. Therefore, integrin activation is an attractive target for immunotherapies, and monitoring the effect of agents on integrin activation is necessary during preclinical drug development. The activation of integrins involves the structural rearrangement of both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains.

In Escherichia coli, the SMC complex MukBEF plays roles in chromosome segregation and organization. We used single-molecule millisecond multicolor fluorescence microscopy of live bacteria to reveal that a dimer of dimeric fluorescent MukBEF molecules acts as the minimal functional unit. On average, 8 to 10 of these complexes accumulated as "spots" in one to three discrete chromosome-associated regions of the cell, where they formed higher-order structures. Functional MukBEF within spots exchanged with freely diffusing complexes at a rate of one complex about every 50 seconds in reactions requiring adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Thus, by functioning in pairs, MukBEF complexes may undergo multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis without being released from DNA, analogous to the behavior of well-characterized molecular motors.},

We show that the "glycosylation problem" can be solved by expressing glycoproteins transiently in mammalian cells in the presence of the N-glycosylation processing inhibitors, kifunensine or swainsonine. This allows the correct folding of the glycoproteins, but leaves them sensitive to enzymes, such as endoglycosidase H, that reduce the N-glycans to single residues, enhancing crystallization. Since the scalability of transient mammalian expression is now comparable to that of bacterial systems, this approach should relieve one of the major bottlenecks in structural genomic analysis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent studies have indicated the existence of tumorigenesis barriers that slow or inhibit the progression of preneoplastic lesions to neoplasia. One such barrier involves DNA replication stress, which leads to activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and thereby to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, whereas a second barrier is mediated by oncogene-induced senescence. The relationship between these two barriers, if any, has not been elucidated. Here we show that oncogene-induced senescence is associated with signs of DNA replication stress, including prematurely terminated DNA replication forks and DNA double-strand breaks. Inhibiting the DNA double-strand break response kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) suppressed the induction of senescence and in a mouse model led to increased tumour size and invasiveness. Analysis of human precancerous lesions further indicated that DNA damage and senescence markers cosegregate closely. Thus, senescence in human preneoplastic lesions is a manifestation of oncogene-induced DNA replication stress and, together with apoptosis, provides a barrier to malignant progression.},

We here highlight two other pathways in myeloid dendritic cells, those of lipid antigen presentation in association with CD1 and of peptide cross-presentation via Class I MHC complexes. Some pathogens evade immune recognition through inhibition of antigen presentation of phagosomal origin. Deviations in endosomal antigen processing and presentation are also seen in individuals suffering from glycosphingolipid lysosomal lipid storage diseases.

abstract = {The functions of proteins and RNAs are defined by the collective interactions of many residues, and yet most statistical models of biological sequences consider sites nearly independently. Recent approaches have demonstrated benefits of including interactions to capture pairwise covariation, but leave higher-order dependencies out of reach. Here we show how it is possible to capture higher-order, context-dependent constraints in biological sequences via latent variable models with nonlinear dependencies. We found that DeepSequence (

                ), a probabilistic model for sequence families, predicted the effects of mutations across a variety of deep mutational scanning experiments substantially better than existing methods based on the same evolutionary data. The model, learned in an unsupervised manner solely on the basis of sequence information, is grounded with biologically motivated priors, reveals the latent organization of sequence families, and can be used to explore new parts of sequence space.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress may underlie age-dependent memory loss and cognitive decline. Toxic aldehydes, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), an end product of lipid peroxides, are known to accumulate in the brain in neurodegenerative disease. We have previously shown that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) detoxifies HNE by oxidizing its aldehyde group. To investigate the role of such toxic aldehydes, we produced transgenic mice, which expressed a dominant-negative form of ALDH2 in the brain. The mice had decreased ability to detoxify HNE in their cortical neurons and accelerated accumulation of HNE in the brain. Consequently, their lifespan was shortened and age-dependent neurodegeneration and hyperphosphorylation of tau were observed. Object recognition and Morris water maze tests revealed that the onset of cognitive impairment correlated with the degeneration, which was further accelerated by APOE (apolipoprotein E) knock-out; therefore, the accumulation of toxic aldehydes is by itself critical in the progression of neurodegenerative disease, which could be suppressed by ALDH2.

While the GLIA in the Drosophila embryo have been well characterized, their study in the adult nervous system has been limited. Here, we present a detailed description of the glia in the adult nervous system, based on the analysis of some 500 glial drivers we identified within a collection of synthetic GAL4 lines. We find that glia make up ∼10{\%} of the cells in the nervous system and envelop all compartments of neurons (soma, dendrites, axons) as well as the nervous system as a whole. Our morphological analysis suggests a set of simple rules governing the morphogenesis of glia and their interactions with other cells. All glial subtypes minimize contact with their glial neighbors but maximize their contact with neurons and adapt their macromorphology and micromorphology to the neuronal entities they envelop. Finally, glial cells show no obvious spatial organization or registration with neuronal entities. Our detailed description of all glial subtypes and their regional specializations, together with the powerful genetic toolkit we provide, will facilitate the functional analysis of glia in the mature nervous system.

abstract = {The annotation of protein function at genomic scale is essential for day-to-day work in biology and for any systematic approach to the modeling of biological systems. Currently, functional annotation is essentially based on the expansion of the relatively small number of experimentally determined functions to large collections of proteins. The task of systematic annotation faces formidable practical problems related to the accuracy of the input experimental information, the reliability of current systems for transferring information between related sequences, and the reproducibility of the links between database information and the original experiments reported in publications. These technical difficulties merely lie on the surface of the deeper problem of the evolution of protein function in the context of protein sequences and structures. Given the mixture of technical and scientific challenges, it is not surprising that errors are introduced, and expanded, in database annotations. In this situation, a more realistic option is the development of a reliability index for database annotations, instead of depending exclusively on efforts to correct databases. Several groups have attempted to compare the database annotations of similar proteins, which constitutes the first steps toward the calibration of the relationship between sequence and annotation space.},

abstract = {Many important problems involve clustering large datasets. Although naive implementations of clustering are computationally expensive, there are established efficient techniques for clustering when the dataset has either (1) a limited number of clusters, (2) a low feature dimensionality, or (3) a small number of data points. However, there has been much less work on methods of efficiently clustering datasets that are large in all three ways at once-for example, having millions of data points that exist in many thousands of dimensions representing many thousands of clusters. We present a new technique for clustering these large, high-dimensional datasets. The key idea involves using a cheap, approximate distance measure to efficiently divide the data into overlapping subsets we call canopies. Then clustering is performed by measuring exact distances only between points that occur in a common canopy. Using canopies, large clustering problems that were formerly impossible become practical. Under reasonable assumptions about the cheap distance metric, this reduction in computational cost comes without any loss in clustering accuracy. Canopies can be applied to many domains and used with a variety of clustering approaches, including Greedy Agglomerative Clustering, K-means and Expectation-Maximization. We present experimental results on grouping bibliographic citations from the reference sections of research papers. Here the canopy approach reduces computation time over a traditional clustering approach by more than an order of magnitude and decreases error in comparison to a previously used algorithm by 25{\%}.},

abstract = {The NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, couples the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone with a translocation of protons across the membrane. The complex consists of a peripheral arm catalyzing the electron transfer reaction and a membrane arm involved in proton translocation. The recently published X-ray structures of the complex revealed the presence of a unique 110 {\AA} "horizontal" helix aligning the membrane arm. On the basis of this finding, it was proposed that the energy released by the redox reaction is transmitted to the membrane arm via a conformational change in the horizontal helix. The helix corresponds to the C-terminal part of the most distal subunit NuoL. To investigate its role in proton translocation, we characterized the electron transfer and proton translocation activity of complex I variants lacking either NuoL or parts of the C-terminal domain. Our data suggest that the H+/2e- stoichiometry of the $\Delta$NuoL variant is 2, indicating a different stoichiometry for proton translocation as proposed from structural data. In addition, the same H+/e- stoichiometry is obtained with the variant lacking the C-terminal transmembraneous helix of NuoL, indicating its role in energy transmission.},

These alterations render the aging brain vulnerable to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and stroke. Emerging findings are revealing mechanisms by which sedentary overindulgent lifestyles accelerate brain aging, whereas lifestyles that include intermittent bioenergetic challenges (exercise, fasting, and intellectual challenges) foster healthy brain aging. Here we provide an overview of the cellular and molecular biology of brain aging, how those processes interface with disease-specific neurodegenerative pathways, and how metabolic states influence brain health. Mattson and Arumugam provide a comprehensive view of the cellular and molecular biology of brain aging and discuss how metabolic states influence brain health, including susceptibility to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and stroke.

We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive C$\alpha$ positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted $\beta$-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues.

It appears that the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair, which could involve the integration of several pathways, is broader than that of BRCA2. BRCA1 functions in the signalling of DNA damage and its repair by homologous recombination, nucleotide-excision repair and possibly non-homologous end-joining. BRCA2 has a more specific role in DNA repair, regulating the activity of RAD51, which is required for homologous recombination. An improved understanding of the interactions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 with other proteins in large macromolecular complexes is helping to reveal their exact role in DNA repair.},

First, not only is the volume of pure sequence and structure data growing, but its diversity is growing as well, leading to a disproportionate growth in the number of uncharacterized gene products. Consequently, established methods of gene and protein annotation, such as homology-based transfer, are annotating less data and in many cases are amplifying existing erroneous annotation. Second, there is a need for a functional annotation which is standardized and machine readable so that function prediction programs could be incorporated into larger workflows. This is problematic due to the subjective and contextual definition of protein function. Third, there is a need to assess the quality of function predictors. Again, the subjectivity of the term 'function' and the various aspects of biological function make this a challenging effort.

Most, perhaps all, CGIs are sites of transcription initiation, including thousands that are remote from currently annotated promoters. Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition.

abstract = {CD1a is expressed on Langerhans cells (LCs) and dendritic cells (DCs), where it mediates T cell recognition of glycolipid and lipopeptide antigens that contain either one or two alkyl chains. We demonstrate here that CD1a-restricted T cells can discriminate the peptide component of didehydroxymycobactin lipopeptides. Structure analysis of CD1a cocrystallized with a synthetic mycobactin lipopeptide at 2.8 A resolution further reveals that the single alkyl chain is inserted deep within the A' pocket of the groove, whereas its two peptidic branches protrude along the F' pocket to the outer, alpha-helical surface of CD1a for recognition by the TCR. Remarkably, the cyclized lysine branch of the peptide moiety lies in the shallow F' pocket in a conformation that closely mimics that of the alkyl chain in the CD1a-sulfatide structure. Thus, this structural study illustrates how a single chain lipid can be presented by CD1 and that the peptide moiety of the lipopeptide is recognized by the TCR.},

abstract = {Chromatin is not an inert structure, but rather an instructive DNA scaffold that can respond to external cues to regulate the many uses of DNA. A principle component of chromatin that plays a key role in this regulation is the modification of histones. There is an ever-growing list of these modifications and the complexity of their action is only just beginning to be understood. However, it is clear that histone modifications play fundamental roles in most biological processes that are involved in the manipulation and expression of DNA. Here, we describe the known histone modifications, define where they are found genomically and discuss some of their functional consequences, concentrating mostly on transcription where the majority of characterisation has taken place.},

abstract = {Antibodies have widespread applications in areas ranging from therapeutics to chromatography and protein microarrays. Certain applications require only the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) units of the protein. This study compares the cleavage efficacy of dithiothreitol (DTT), mercaptoethylamine (MEA), and dithiobutylamine (DTBA) - a relatively new reducing agent synthesized in 2012. Pseudo-first order kinetic analyses show DTBA to be {\~{}}213 times faster than DTT and {\~{}}71 times faster than MEA in the formation of Fab[U+05F3] antibody fragments from polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Monoclonal mouse antibodies were also used to show the feasibility of the reduction process on antibodies from a different species and with a different clonality. DTBA cleaved the monoclonal mouse F(ab)2 units most efficiently, {\~{}}2 times faster than DTT {\~{}}10 times faster than MEA. Due to the extremely quick reactivity of all the reducing agents in the first five minutes of monoclonal antibody reductions as well as for the DTBA reductions of the polyclonal rabbit antibodies, the pseudo-first order kinetic analyses should be interpreted qualitatively for these results. Nucleophilic sulfides on Fab' fragments are preserved in the DTBA reduction process, demonstrated by their reactivity with Ellman's reagent. Degradation of the Fab' fragments was observed with the monoclonal mouse antibodies after reduction with DTBA or DTT. In conclusion, DTBA is the more efficient reducing agent compared to DTT and MEA, however, the reduction process should be optimized as degradation of the Fab' fragments is possible.},

abstract = {Acidic residues which are found on transmembrane segments within the lactose permease may play an important role in H+ and/or sugar recognition. To examine the functional roles of Glu-269 and Glu-325, we have constructed a variety of amino acid substitutions (e.g. aspartate, glycine, alanine, serine, or glutamine) via site-directed mutagenesis. At position 269, all mutations appear to have a detrimental effect on sugar affinity, downhill transport, and counterflow. The Asp-269 mutant was able to accumulate lactose against a concentration gradient, whereas all of the nonionizable substitutions at position 269 were completely defective. Nevertheless, in spite of their inability to actively accumulate sugars, Gly-269, Ala-269, and Gln-269 mutants were observed to transport H+ upon the addition of galactosides. Mutations at position 325 had a markedly different phenotype. For example, the Asp-325, Gly-325, and Gln-325 mutants exhibited an apparent Km for lactose transport (e.g. 0.21, 0.47, and 0.50 mM, respectively), which was actually lower than that of the wild-type strain (1.44 mM). In counterflow assays, all position 325 mutants also appear to catalyze lactose exchange. Similar to the results obtained at position 269, the Asp-325 mutant exhibited moderate levels of accumulation, whereas none of the nonionizable mutations at position 325 were able to accumulate galactosides against a concentration gradient. However, unlike the position 269 mutants, no H+ transport was observed in the Gly-325, Ala-325, Ser-325, or Gln-325 strains upon the addition of lactose, S-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,1)-beta-thiogalactopyranoside, 1-O-methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, or melibiose. Furthermore, in these mutants, the efflux of lactose during counterflow assays became insensitive to delta pH. Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that an acidic residue at position 325 is required for H+ transport via the lactose permease. Alternative hypotheses are also discussed.},

abstract = {Reference genomes are required to understand the diverse roles of microorganisms in ecology, evolution, human and animal health, but most species remain uncultured. Here we present a sequence composition-independent approach to recover high-quality microbial genomes from deeply sequenced metagenomes. Multiple metagenomes of the same community, which differ in relative population abundances, were used to assemble 31 bacterial genomes, including rare ({\textless}1{\%} relative abundance) species, from an activated sludge bioreactor. Twelve genomes were assembled into complete or near-complete chromosomes. Four belong to the candidate bacterial phylum TM7 and represent the most complete genomes for this phylum to date (relative abundances, 0.06-1.58{\%}). Reanalysis of published metagenomes reveals that differential coverage binning facilitates recovery of more complete and higher fidelity genome bins than other currently used methods, which are primarily based on sequence composition. This approach will be an important addition to the standard metagenome toolbox and greatly improve access to genomes of uncultured microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/.},

abstract = {Exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are cis-regulatory elements that inhibit the use of adjacent splice sites, often contributing to alternative splicing (AS). To systematically identify ESSs, an in vivo splicing reporter system was developed to screen a library of random decanucleotides. The screen yielded 141 ESS decamers, 133 of which were unique. The silencer activity of over a dozen of these sequences was also confirmed in a heterologous exon/intron context and in a second cell type. Of the unique ESS decamers, most could be clustered into groups to yield seven putative ESS motifs, some resembling known motifs bound by hnRNPs H and A1. Potential roles of ESSs in constitutive splicing were explored using an algorithm, ExonScan, which simulates splicing based on known or putative splicing-related motifs. ExonScan and related bioinformatic analyses suggest that these ESS motifs play important roles in suppression of pseudoexons, in splice site definition, and in AS.},

Applying these methods to five complete proteomes, we found that 30-65{\%} of all predicted signal peptides and 25-35{\%} of all predicted transmembrane topologies overlap. This impairs predictions of 5-10{\%} of the proteome, hence this is an important issue in protein annotation. To address this problem, we previously designed a hidden Markov model, Phobius, that combines transmembrane topology and signal peptide predictions. The method makes an optimal choice between transmembrane segments and signal peptides, and also allows constrained and homology-enriched predictions. We here present a web interface (http://phobius.cgb.ki.se and http://phobius.binf.ku.dk) to access Phobius.},

abstract = {Defects in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) have been associated with Alzheimer's Disease, in which the age-dependent accumulation of $\beta$-amyloid plays an important role in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. To test the possibility that age-dependent decline in the mitochondrial respiratory function, especially COX activity, may participate in the formation and accumulation of $\beta$-amyloid, we generated mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein and mutant presenilin 1 in a neuron-specific COX-deficient background. A neuron-specific COX-deficient mouse was generated by the Cre-loxP system, in which the COX10 gene was deleted by a CamKII$\alpha$ promoter-driven Cre-recombinase. COX10 is a farnesyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of heme a, required for COX assembly and function. These KO mice showed an age-dependent COX deficiency in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Surprisingly, COX10 KO mice exhibited significantly fewer amyloid plaques in their brains compared with the COX-competent transgenic mice. This reduction in amyloid plaques in the KO mouse was accompanied by a reduction in A$\beta$42 level, $\beta$-secretase activity, and oxidative damage. Likewise, production of reactive oxygen species from cells with partial COX activity was not elevated. Collectively, our results suggest that, contrary to previous models, a defect in neuronal COX does not increase oxidative damage nor predispose for the formation of amyloidgenic amyloid precursor protein fragments. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) are among the most dangerous forms of DNA damage. Unrepaired DSBs results in cells undergoing apoptosis or senescence whereas mis-processing of DSBs can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. One important pathway in eukaryotic cells responsible for the repair of DSBs is non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). In this review we will discuss the interesting new insights into the mechanism of the NHEJ pathway and the proteins which mediate this repair process. Furthermore, the general role of NHEJ in promoting genomic stability will be discussed.},

New single-molecule techniques have elucidated many molecular details of nucleosome disassembly and what happens once Pol II encounters a nucleosome. Our review highlights mechanisms that Pol II utilizes to transcribe through nucleosomes, including the roles of chromatin remodelers, histone chaperones, post-translational modifications of histones, incorporation of histone variants into nucleosomes, and activation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme. Future studies need to assess the molecular details and the contribution of each of these mechanisms, individually and in combination, to transcription across the genome to understand how cells are able to regulate transcription in response to developmental, environmental and nutritional cues.},

abstract = {We have identified a new protein fold--the alpha/beta hydrolase fold--that is common to several hydrolytic enzymes of widely differing phylogenetic origin and catalytic function. The core of each enzyme is similar: an alpha/beta sheet, not barrel, of eight beta-sheets connected by alpha-helices. These enzymes have diverged from a common ancestor so as to preserve the arrangement of the catalytic residues, not the binding site. They all have a catalytic triad, the elements of which are borne on loops which are the best-conserved structural features in the fold. Only the histidine in the nucleophile-histidine-acid catalytic triad is completely conserved, with the nucleophile and acid loops accommodating more than one type of amino acid. The unique topological and sequence arrangement of the triad residues produces a catalytic triad which is, in a sense, a mirror-image of the serine protease catalytic triad. There are now four groups of enzymes which contain catalytic triads and which are related by convergent evolution towards a stable, useful active site: the eukaryotic serine proteases, the cysteine proteases, subtilisins and the alpha/beta hydrolase fold enzymes.},

Here we describe a 1.9 A resolution structure of junctional AQP0, determined by electron crystallography of double-layered two-dimensional crystals. Comparison of junctional and non-junctional AQP0 structures shows that junction formation depends on a conformational switch in an extracellular loop, which may result from cleavage of the cytoplasmic amino and carboxy termini. In the centre of the water pathway, the closed pore in junctional AQP0 retains only three water molecules, which are too widely spaced to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Packing interactions between AQP0 tetramers in the crystalline array are mediated by lipid molecules, which assume preferred conformations. We were therefore able to build an atomic model for the lipid bilayer surrounding the AQP0 tetramers, and we describe lipid-protein interactions.},

Nevertheless, precisely these issues can be addressed in neutral models, such as those elaborated here with regard to scrambled ciliate genes, gRNA-mediated RNA editing, the transition from self-splicing to spliceosomal splicing, and the retention of duplicate genes. All of these are instances of a more general scheme of 'constructive neutral evolution' that invokes biased variation, epistatic interactions, and excess capacities to account for a complex series of steps giving rise to novel structures or operations. The directional and constructive outcomes of these models are due not to neutral allele fixations per se, but to these other factors. Neutral models of this type may help to clarify the poorly understood role of nonselective factors in evolutionary innovation and directionality.},

abstract = {The major barrier to treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is its unknown etiology and pathogenesis. Although increasing evidence supports a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD, there have been few studies that simultaneously evaluate changes in multiple mitochondrial proteins. To evaluate changes in sites of potentially interacting mitochondrial proteins, we applied 2-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and the isotope coded affinity tag method to identify and quantify proteins in mitochondrial enriched fractions isolated from short postmortem interval temporal pole specimens from subjects with mild cognitive impairment (4 subjects pooled), early AD (4 subjects pooled), late-stage AD (8 subjects pooled) and age-matched normal control (7 subjects pooled) subjects. A total of 112 unique, non-redundant proteins were identified and quantified in common to all three stages of disease progression. Overall, patterns of protein change suggest activation of mitochondrial pathways that include proteins responsible for transport and utilization of ATP. These proteins include adenine nucleotide translocase, voltage dependent anion channels, hexokinase, and creatine kinase. Comparison of protein changes throughout the progression of AD suggests the most pronounced changes occur in early AD mitochondria. {\textcopyright} 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

High throughput technologies (genomics, transciptomics, lipidomics, and proteomics) are now being applied to tissue derived from pain patients as well as experimental pain models to discover novel pain mediators. The use of clustering, meta-analysis and other techniques can help refine potential candidates. Of particular importance are systems biology methods, such as co-expression network generating algorithms, which infer potential associations/interactions between molecules and build networks based on these interactions. Protein-protein interaction networks allow the lists of potential targets generated by these different platforms to be analyzed in their biological context. Outputs from these different methods must also be related to the clinical pain phenotype. The improved and standardized phenotyping of pain symptoms and sensory signs enables much better subject stratification. Our hope is that, in the future, the use of computational approaches to integrate datasets including sensory phenotype as well as the outputs of high throughput technologies will help define novel pain mediators and provide insights into the pathogenesis of chronic pain.},

abstract = {Background: Most successful computational approaches for protein function prediction integrate multiple genomics and proteomics data sources to make inferences about the function of unknown proteins. The most accurate of these algorithms have long running times, making them unsuitable for real-time protein function prediction in large genomes. As a result, the predictions of these algorithms are stored in static databases that can easily become outdated. We propose a new algorithm, GeneMANIA, that is as accurate as the leading methods, while capable of predicting protein function in real-time. Results: We use a fast heuristic algorithm, derived from ridge regression, to integrate multiple functional association networks and predict gene function from a single process-specific network using label propagation. Our algorithm is efficient enough to be deployed on a modern webserver and is as accurate as, or more so than, the leading methods on the MouseFunc I benchmark and a new yeast function prediction benchmark; it is robust to redundant and irrelevant data and requires, on average, less than ten seconds of computation time on tasks from these benchmarks. Conclusion: GeneMANIA is fast enough to predict gene function on-the-fly while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a brief overview of tuning strategies we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of genetic variation in human population. One of the most important goals of SNP projects is to understand which human genotype variations are related to Mendelian and complex diseases. Great interest is focused on non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that are responsible of protein single point mutation. nsSNPs can be neutral or disease associated. It is known that the mutation of only one residue in a protein sequence can be related to a number of pathological conditions of dramatic social impact such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's diseases. The quality and completeness of presently available SNPs databases allows the application of machine learning techniques to predict the insurgence of human diseases due to single point protein mutation starting from the protein sequence. RESULTS: In this paper, we develop a method based on support vector machines (SVMs) that starting from the protein sequence information can predict whether a new phenotype derived from a nsSNP can be related to a genetic disease in humans. Using a dataset of 21 185 single point mutations, 61{\%} of which are disease-related, out of 3587 proteins, we show that our predictor can reach more than 74{\%} accuracy in the specific task of predicting whether a single point mutation can be disease related or not. Our method, although based on less information, outperforms other web-available predictors implementing different approaches.

abstract = {This work addresses the problem of detecting clusters in a weighted, undirected, graph by using kernel-based clustering methods, directly partitioning the graph according to a well-defined similarity measure between the nodes (a kernel on a graph). The proposed algorithms are based on a two-step procedure. First, a kernel or similarity matrix, providing a meaningful similarity measure between any couple of nodes, is computed from the adjacency matrix of the graph. Then, the nodes of the graph are clustered by performing a kernel clustering on this similarity matrix. Besides the introduction of a prototype-based kernel version of the gaussian mixtures model and Ward's hierarchical clustering, in addition to the already known kernel k-means and fuzzy k-means, a new kernel, called the sigmoid commute-time kernel (KCTS) is presented. The joint use of the KCTS kernel matrix and kernel clustering appears to be quite effective. Indeed, this methodology provides the best results on a systematic comparison with a selection of graph clustering and communities detection algorithms on three real-world databases. Finally, some links between the proposed hierarchical kernel clustering and spectral clustering are examined. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Protein movements underlying ligand-gated ion channel activation are poorly understood. The binding of agonist initiates a series of conformational movements that ultimately lead to the opening of the ion channel pore. Although little is known about local movements within the GABA-binding site, a recent structural model of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) ligand-binding domain predicts that beta2Glu155 is a key residue for direct interactions with the neurotransmitter (Cromer et al., 2002). To elucidate the role of the beta2Ile154-Asp163 region in GABA(A)R activation, each residue was individually mutated to cysteine and coexpressed with wild-type alpha1 subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Seven mutations increased the GABA EC50 value (8- to 3400-fold), whereas three mutations (E155C, S156C, and G158C) also significantly increased the 2-(3-carboxypropyl)-3-amino-6-(4-methoxyphenyl) pyridazinium (SR-95531) K(I) value. GABA, SR-95531, and pentobarbital slowed N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate modification of T160C and D163C, indicating that beta2Thr160 and beta2Asp163 are located in or near the GABA-binding site and that this region undergoes structural rearrangements during channel gating. Cysteine substitution of beta2Glu155 resulted in spontaneously open GABA(A)Rs and differentially decreased the GABA, piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (partial agonist), and SR-95531 sensitivities, indicating that the mutation perturbs ligand binding as well as channel gating. Tethering thiol-reactive groups onto beta2E155C closed the spontaneously open channels, suggesting that beta2Glu155 is a control element involved in coupling ligand binding to channel gating. Structural modeling suggests that the beta2 Ile154-Asp163 region is a protein hinge that forms a network of interconnections that couples binding site movements to the cascade of events leading to channel opening.},

Here we tested 21 representative DNA extraction protocols on the same fecal samples and quantified differences in observed microbial community composition. We compared them with differences due to library preparation and sample storage, which we contrasted with observed biological variation within the same specimen or within an individual over time. We found that DNA extraction had the largest effect on the outcome of metagenomic analysis. To rank DNA extraction protocols, we considered resulting DNA quantity and quality, and we ascertained biases in estimates of community diversity and the ratio between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We recommend a standardized DNA extraction method for human fecal samples, for which transferability across labs was established and which was further benchmarked using a mock community of known composition. Its adoption will improve comparability of human gut microbiome studies and facilitate meta-analyses.},

@article{Akyuz2013,
abstract = {Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse neurotransmitter uptake from the synaptic cleft into the cytoplasm of glial cells and neurons. Their mechanism of action involves transitions between extracellular (outward)-facing and intracellular (inward)-facing conformations, whereby substrate binding sites become accessible to either side of the membrane. This process has been proposed to entail transmembrane movements of three discrete transport domains within a trimeric scaffold. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging, we have directly observed large-scale transport domain movements in a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters. We find that individual transport domains alternate between periods of quiescence and periods of rapid transitions, reminiscent of bursting patterns first recorded in single ion channels using patch-clamp methods. We propose that the switch to the dynamic mode in glutamate transporters is due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold, which precedes domain movements across the bilayer. This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining in the transport cycle.},

abstract = {Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source in prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and metazoans. However, excess of glucose has been associated with several diseases, including diabetes and the less understood process of aging. On the contrary, limiting glucose (i.e., calorie restriction) slows aging and age-related diseases in most species. Understanding the mechanism by which glucose limits life span is therefore important for any attempt to control aging and age-related diseases. Here, we use the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to study the regulation of chronological life span by glucose. Growth of S. pombe at a reduced concentration of glucose increased life span and oxidative stress resistance as reported before for many other organisms. Surprisingly, loss of the Git3 glucose receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, also increased life span in conditions where glucose consumption was not affected. These results suggest a role for glucose-signaling pathways in life span regulation. In agreement, constitutive activation of the Galpha subunit acting downstream of Git3 accelerated aging in S. pombe and inhibited the effects of calorie restriction. A similar pro-aging effect of glucose was documented in mutants of hexokinase, which cannot metabolize glucose and, therefore, are exposed to constitutive glucose signaling. The pro-aging effect of glucose signaling on life span correlated with an increase in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in oxidative stress resistance and respiration rate. Likewise, the anti-aging effect of both calorie restriction and the Deltagit3 mutation was accompanied by increased respiration and lower reactive oxygen species production. Altogether, our data suggest an important role for glucose signaling through the Git3/PKA pathway to regulate S. pombe life span.},

abstract = {The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network has a small number of highly connected protein nodes (known as hubs) and many poorly connected nodes. Genome-wide studies show that deletion of a hub protein is more likely to be lethal than deletion of a non-hub protein, a phenomenon known as the centrality-lethality rule. This rule is widely believed to reflect the special importance of hubs in organizing the network, which in turn suggests the biological significance of network architectures, a key notion of systems biology. Despite the popularity of this explanation, the underlying cause of the centrality-lethality rule has never been critically examined. We here propose the concept of essential PPIs, which are PPIs that are indispensable for the survival or reproduction of an organism. Our network analysis suggests that the centrality-lethality rule is unrelated to the network architecture, but is explained by the simple fact that hubs have large numbers of PPIs, therefore high probabilities of engaging in essential PPIs. We estimate that approximately 3{\%} of PPIs are essential in the yeast, accounting for approximately 43{\%} of essential genes. As expected, essential PPIs are evolutionarily more conserved than nonessential PPIs. Considering the role of essential PPIs in determining gene essentiality, we find the yeast PPI network functionally more robust than random networks, yet far less robust than the potential optimum. These and other findings provide new perspectives on the biological relevance of network structure and robustness.},

We show that recombinant TopBP1 induces a large increase in the kinase activity of both Xenopus and human ATR. The ATR-activating domain resides in a conserved segment of TopBP1 that is distinct from its numerous BRCT repeats. The isolated ATR-activating domain from TopBP1 induces ectopic activation of ATR-dependent signaling in both Xenopus egg extracts and human cells. Furthermore, Xenopus egg extracts containing a version of TopBP1 with an inactivating point mutation in the ATR-activating domain are defective in checkpoint regulation. These studies establish that activation of ATR by TopBP1 is a crucial step in the initiation of ATR-dependent signaling processes.},

Here, we show the crystal structure of the intact heterotetrameric GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor ion channel at 4 angstroms. The NMDA receptors are arranged as a dimer of GluN1-GluN2B heterodimers with the twofold symmetry axis running through the entire molecule composed of an amino terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), and a transmembrane domain (TMD). The ATD and LBD are much more highly packed in the NMDA receptors than non-NMDA receptors, which may explain why ATD regulates ion channel activity in NMDA receptors but not in non-NMDA receptors.},

New methods were developed for analysing micrographs from tilted specimens, incorporating methods previously developed for untilted specimens that enable large areas to be analysed and corrected for distortions. Data from 72 images, from both tilted and untilted specimens, were analysed to produce the phases of 2700 independent Fourier components of the structure. The amplitudes of these components were accurately measured from 150 diffraction patterns. Together, these data represent about half of the full three-dimensional transform to 3.5 A. The map of the structure has a resolution of 3.5 A in a direction parallel to the membrane plane but lower than this in the perpendicular direction. It shows many features in the density that are resolved from the main density of the seven alpha-helices. We interpret these features as the bulky aromatic side-chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues. There is also a very dense feature, which is the beta-ionone ring of the retinal chromophore. Using these bulky side-chains as guide points and taking account of bulges in the helices that indicate smaller side-chains such as leucine, a complete atomic model for bacteriorhodopsin between amino acid residues 8 and 225 has been built. There are 21 amino acid residues, contributed by all seven helices, surrounding the retinal and 26 residues, contributed by five helices, forming the proton pathway or channel. Ten of the amino acid residues in the middle of the proton channel are also part of the retinal binding site. The model also provides a useful basis for consideration of the mechanism of proton pumping and allows a consistent interpretation of a great deal of other experimental data. In particular, the structure suggests that pK changes in the Schiff base must act as the means by which light energy is converted into proton pumping pressure in the channel. Asp96 is on the pathway from the cytoplasm to the Schiff base and Asp85 is on the pathway from the Schiff base to the extracellular surface.},

abstract = {As the number of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) identified through whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing programs increases, researchers and clinicians are becoming increasingly reliant upon computational prediction algorithms designed to prioritize potential functional variants for further study. A large proportion of existing prediction algorithms are 'disease agnostic' but are nevertheless quite capable of predicting when a mutation is likely to be deleterious. However, most clinical and research applications of these algorithms relate to specific diseases and would therefore benefit from an approach that discriminates between functional variants specifically related to that disease from those which are not. In a whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing context, such an approach could substantially reduce the number of false positive candidate mutations. Here, we test this postulate by incorporating a disease-specific weighting scheme into the Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) algorithm. When compared to traditional prediction algorithms, we observed an overall reduction in the number of false positives identified using a disease-specific approach to functional prediction across 17 distinct disease concepts/categories. Our results illustrate the potential benefits of making disease-specific predictions when prioritizing candidate variants in relation to specific diseases. A web-based implementation of our algorithm is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.},

abstract = {Illumination changes elicit modifications of thylakoid proteins and reorganization of the photosynthetic machinery. This involves, in the short term, phosphorylation of photosystem II (PSII) and light-harvesting (LHCII) proteins. PSII phosphorylation is thought to be relevant for PSII turnover, whereas LHCII phosphorylation is associated with the relocation of LHCII and the redistribution of excitation energy (state transitions) between photosystems. In the long term, imbalances in energy distribution between photosystems are counteracted by adjusting photosystem stoichiometry. In the green alga Chlamydomonas and the plant Arabidopsis, state transitions require the orthologous protein kinases STT7 and STN7, respectively. Here we show that in Arabidopsis a second protein kinase, STN8, is required for the quantitative phosphorylation of PSII core proteins. However, PSII activity under high-intensity light is affected only slightly in stn8 mutants, and D1 turnover is indistinguishable from the wild type, implying that reversible protein phosphorylation is not essential for PSII repair. Acclimation to changes in light quality is defective in stn7 but not in stn8 mutants, indicating that short-term and long-term photosynthetic adaptations are coupled. Therefore the phosphorylation of LHCII, or of an unknown substrate of STN7, is also crucial for the control of photosynthetic gene expression.},

abstract = {Motivation: Recently, a shift was made from using Gene Ontology (GO) to evaluate molecular network data to using these data to construct and evaluate GO. Dutkowski et al. provide the first evidence that a large part of GO can be reconstructed solely from topologies of molecular networks. Motivated by this work, we develop a novel data integration framework that integrates multiple types of molecular network data to reconstruct and update GO. We ask how much of GO can be recovered by integrating various molecular interaction data. Results: We introduce a computational framework for integration of various biological networks using penalized non-negative matrix tri-factorization (PNMTF). It takes all network data in a matrix form and performs simultaneous clustering of genes and GO terms, inducing new relations between genes and GO terms (annotations) and between GO terms themselves. To improve the accuracy of our predicted relations, we extend the integration methodology to include additional topological information represented as the similarity in wiring around non-interacting genes. Surprisingly, by integrating topologies of bakers' yeasts protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction (GI) and co-expression networks, our method reports as related 96{\%} of GO terms that are directly related in GO. The inclusion of the wiring similarity of non-interacting genes contributes 6{\%} to this large GO term association capture. Furthermore, we use our method to infer new relationships between GO terms solely from the topologies of these networks and validate 44{\%} of our predictions in the literature. In addition, our integration method reproduces 48{\%} of cellular component, 41{\%} of molecular function and 41{\%} of biological process GO terms, outperforming the previous method in the former two domains of GO. Finally, we predict new GO annotations of yeast genes and validate our predictions through GIs profiling.

Our further examination of the interactions among these seven cells has led to the following model. Each hypodermal precursor cell becomes determined to adopt one of its three potential fates; each of these fates is to generate a particular cell lineage. In the absence of cellular interactions each precursor cell will generate the nonvulval cell lineage; an inductive signal from the anchor cell is required for a precursor cell to generate either of the two types of vulval cell lineages. The inductive signal is spatially graded, and the potency of the signal specifies which lineage is expressed by each of the tripotential precursor cells.},

Such a homology-based annotation transfer is problematic and limited in scope. Therefore, computational biologists have begun to develop ab initio methods that predict aspects of function, including subcellular localization, post-translational modifications, functional type and protein-protein interactions. For the first two cases, the most accurate approaches rely on identifying short signalling motifs, while the most general methods utilise tools of artificial intelligence. An outstanding new method predicts classes of cellular function directly from sequence. Similarly, promising methods have been developed predicting protein-protein interaction partners at acceptable levels of accuracy for some pairs in entire proteomes. No matter how difficult the task, successes over the last few years have clearly paved the way for ab initio prediction of protein function.},

Here we present the first three-dimensional structure, to our knowledge, of an inhibitory anion-selective Cys-loop receptor, the homopentameric Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel $\alpha$ (GluCl), at 3.3 {\AA} resolution. The X-ray structure of the GluCl-Fab complex was determined with the allosteric agonist ivermectin and in additional structures with the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. Ivermectin, used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.},

A rich tapestry of mechanistic studies on DNA repair has emerged thanks to the recent discovery of Y-family DNA polymerases. Many Y-family members carry out aberrant DNA synthesis-poor replication accuracy, the favored formation of non-Watson-Crick base pairs, efficient mismatch extension, and most importantly, an ability to replicate through DNA damage. This review is devoted primarily to a discussion of Y-family polymerase members that exhibit error-prone behavior. Roles for these remarkable enzymes occur in widely disparate DNA repair pathways, such as UV-induced mutagenesis, adaptive mutation, avoidance of skin cancer, and induction of somatic cell hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes. Individual polymerases engaged in multiple repair pathways pose challenging questions about their roles in targeting and trafficking. Macromolecular assemblies of replication-repair "factories" could enable a cell to handle the complex logistics governing the rapid migration and exchange of polymerases.},

Using step-wise nuclear transformation with five chloroplast-targeted bacterial genes encoding glycolate dehydrogenase, glyoxylate carboligase and tartronic semialdehyde reductase, we generated plants in which chloroplastic glycolate is converted directly to glycerate. This reduces, but does not eliminate, flux of photorespiratory metabolites through peroxisomes and mitochondria. Transgenic plants grew faster, produced more shoot and root biomass, and contained more soluble sugars, reflecting reduced photorespiration and enhanced photosynthesis that correlated with an increased chloroplastic CO(2) concentration in the vicinity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. These effects are evident after overexpression of the three subunits of glycolate dehydrogenase, but enhanced by introducing the complete bacterial glycolate catabolic pathway. Diverting chloroplastic glycolate from photorespiration may improve the productivity of crops with C(3) photosynthesis.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous SecY-Sec61 complex translocates nascent secretory proteins across cellular membranes and integrates membrane proteins into lipid bilayers. Several structures of mostly detergent-solubilized Sec complexes have been reported. Here we present a single-particle cryo-EM structure of the SecYEG complex in a membrane environment, bound to a translating ribosome, at subnanometer resolution. Using the SecYEG complex reconstituted in a so-called Nanodisc, we could trace the nascent polypeptide chain from the peptidyltransferase center into the membrane. The reconstruction allowed for the identification of ribosome-lipid interactions. The rRNA helix 59 (H59) directly contacts the lipid surface and appears to modulate the membrane in immediate vicinity to the proposed lateral gate of the protein-conducting channel (PCC). On the basis of our map and molecular dynamics simulations, we present a model of a signal anchor-gated PCC in the membrane.},

abstract = {It is more than 80 years since Gratia first described 'a remarkable antagonism between two strains of Escherichia coli'. Shown subsequently to be due to the action of proteins (or peptides) produced by one bacterium to kill closely related species with which it might be cohabiting, such bacteriocins have since been shown to be commonplace in the internecine warfare between bacteria. Bacteriocins have been studied primarily from the twin perspectives of how they shape microbial communities and how they penetrate bacteria to kill them. Here, we review the modes of action of a family of bacteriocins that cleave nucleic acid substrates in E. coli, known collectively as nuclease colicins, and the specific immunity (inhibitor) proteins that colicin-producing organisms make in order to avoid committing suicide. In a process akin to targeting in mitochondria, nuclease colicins engage in a variety of cellular associations in order to translocate their cytotoxic domains through the cell envelope to the cytoplasm. As well as informing on the process itself, the study of nuclease colicin import has also illuminated functional aspects of the host proteins they parasitize. We also review recent studies where nuclease colicins and their immunity proteins have been used as model systems for addressing fundamental problems in protein folding and protein-protein interactions, areas of biophysics that are intimately linked to the role of colicins in bacterial competition and to the import process itself.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (A$\beta$) peptides impair multiple cellular pathways and play a causative role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but how the brain proteome is remodeled by this process is unknown. To identify protein networks associated with AD-like pathology, we performed global quantitative proteomic analysis in three mouse models at young and old ages. Our analysis revealed a robust increase in Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels in nearly all brain regions with increased A$\beta$ levels. Taken together with prior findings on ApoE driving A$\beta$ accumulation, this analysis points to a pathological dysregulation of the ApoE-A$\beta$ axis. We also found dysregulation of protein networks involved in excitatory synaptic transmission. Analysis of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complex revealed specific loss of TARP$\gamma$-2, a key AMPAR-trafficking protein. Expression of TARP$\gamma$-2 in hAPP transgenic mice restored AMPA currents. This proteomic database represents a resource for the identification of protein alterations responsible for AD.},

abstract = {Background: The study of late-onset/age-related Alzheimer's disease (AD)(sporadic AD, 95{\%} of AD cases) has been hampered by a paucity of animal models. Oxidative stress is considered a causative factor in late onset/age-related AD, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is important for the catabolism of toxic aldehydes associated with oxidative stress. One such toxic aldehyde, the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), accumulates in AD brain and is associated with AD pathology. Given this linkage, we hypothesized that in mice lacking ALDH2, there would be increases in HNE and the appearance of AD-like pathological changes. Results: Changes in relevant AD markers in Aldh2-/- mice and their wildtype littermates were assessed over a 1 year period. Marked increases in HNE adducts arise in hippocampi from Aldh2-/- mice, as well as age-related increases in amyloid-beta, p-tau, and activated caspases. Also observed were age-related decreases in pGSK3$\beta$, PSD95, synaptophysin, CREB and pCREB. Age-related memory deficits in the novel object recognition and Y maze tasks begin at 3.5-4 months and are maximal at 6.5-7 months. There was decreased performance in the Morris Water Maze task in 6 month old Aldh2-/- mice. These mice exhibited endothelial dysfunction, increased amyloid-beta in cerebral microvessels, decreases in carbachol-induced pCREB and pERK formation in hippocampal slices, and brain atrophy. These AD-associated pathological changes are rarely observed as a constellation in current AD animal models. Conclusions: We believe that this new model of age-related cognitive impairment will provide new insight into the pathogenesis and molecular/cellular mechanisms driving neurodegenerative diseases of aging such as AD, and will prove useful for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic agents for improving memory and for slowing, preventing, or reversing AD progression.},

abstract = {The cycle of eukaryotic transcription, from initiation to elongation and termination is regulated at multiple steps. Coordinated action of regulatory factors keeps in check the transcriptional competence of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at different stages. Productive transcription requires the escape of the paused RNAPII from the promoter and transition to rapid elongation of the transcript. Numerous studies have identified diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter. The general theme that has emerged is that the balance between positive and negative regulatory factors determines the overall rate of transcription. Recently transcription termination has emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation that is coupled with the efficient recycling of RNAPII. The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation. This review highlights these regulatory steps, the key modulators involved in transcription dynamics, and the emerging tools to analyze them.},

Interestingly, mice lacking SIRT3 (SIRT3KO), either spontaneously or when crossed with mouse models of disease, develop several diseases of aging at an accelerated pace, such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases, and, thus, might be a valuable model of accelerated aging. In this review, we discuss functions of SIRT3 in pathways involved in diseases of aging and how the lack of SIRT3 might accelerate the aging process.

abstract = {DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) represent the major DNA double strand break (DSB) pathways in mammalian cells, whilst ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) lies at the core of the DSB signalling response. ATM signalling plays a major role in modifying chromatin structure in the vicinity of the DSB and increasing evidence suggests that this function influences the DSB rejoining process. DSBs have long been known to be repaired with two (or more) component kinetics. The majority (∼85{\%}) of DSBs are repaired with fast kinetics in a predominantly ATM-independent manner. In contrast, ∼15{\%} of radiation-induced DSBs are repaired with markedly slower kinetics via a process that requires ATM and those mediator proteins, such as MDC1 or 53BP1, that accumulate at ionising radiation induced foci (IRIF). DSBs repaired with slow kinetics predominantly localise to the periphery of genomic heterochromatin (HC). Indeed, there is mounting evidence that chromatin complexity and not damage complexity confers slow DSB repair kinetics. ATM's role in HC-DSB repair involves the direct phosphorylation of KAP-1, a key HC formation factor. KAP-1 phosphorylation (pKAP-1) arises in both a pan-nuclear and a focal manner after radiation and ATM-dependent pKAP-1 is essential for DSB repair within HC regions. Mediator proteins such as 53BP1, which are also essential for HC-DSB repair, are expendable for pan-nuclear pKAP-1 whilst being essential for pKAP-1 formation at IRIF. Data suggests that the essential function of the mediator proteins is to promote the retention of activated ATM at DSBs, concentrating the phosphorylation of KAP-1 at HC DSBs. DSBs arising in G2 phase are also repaired with fast and slow kinetics but, in contrast to G0/G1 where they all DSBs are repaired by NHEJ, the slow component of DSB repair in G2 phase represents an HR process involving the Artemis endonuclease. Results suggest that whilst NHEJ repairs the majority of DSBs in G2 phase, Artemis-dependent HR uniquely repairs HC DSBs. Collectively, these recent studies highlight not only how chromatin complexity influences the factors required for DSB repair but also the pathway choice.},

Here, we elucidate the structures of the intact GluA2 AMPA receptor in an apo resting/closed state, in an activated/pre-open state bound with partial agonists and a positive allosteric modulator, and in a desensitized/closed state in complex with fluorowilliardiine. To probe the conformational properties of these states, we carried out double electron-electron resonance experiments on cysteine mutants and cryoelectron microscopy studies. We show how agonist binding modulates the conformation of the ligand-binding domain "layer" of the intact receptors and how, upon desensitization, the receptor undergoes large conformational rearrangements of the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. We define mechanistic principles by which to understand antagonism, activation, and desensitization in AMPA iGluRs.},

abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes most of the biological oxygen consumption on Earth, a process responsible for energy supply in aerobic organisms. This remarkable membrane-bound enzyme also converts free energy from O(2) reduction to an electrochemical proton gradient by functioning as a redox-linked proton pump. Although the structures of several oxidases are known, the molecular mechanism of redox-linked proton translocation has remained elusive. Here, correlated internal electron and proton transfer reactions were tracked in real time by spectroscopic and electrometric techniques after laser-activated electron injection into the oxidized enzyme. The observed kinetics establish the long-sought reaction sequence of the proton pump mechanism and describe some of its thermodynamic properties. The 10-micros electron transfer to heme a raises the pK(a) of a "pump site," which is loaded by a proton from the inside of the membrane in 150 micros. This loading increases the redox potentials of both hemes a and a(3), which allows electron equilibration between them at the same rate. Then, in 0.8 ms, another proton is transferred from the inside to the heme a(3)/Cu(B) center, and the electron is transferred to Cu(B). Finally, in 2.6 ms, the preloaded proton is released from the pump site to the opposite side of the membrane.},

abstract = {Apoptotic death of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is a prominent feature of blood vessel remodeling. In the present study, we examined the novel PKC isoform protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) and its role in vascular SMC apoptosis. In A10 SMCs, overexpression of PKCdelta was sufficient to induce apoptosis, whereas inhibition of PKCdelta diminished H2O2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, evidence is provided that the tumor suppressor p53 is an essential mediator of PKCdelta-induced apoptosis in SMCs. Activation of PKCdelta led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking p53 induction with small interference RNA or targeted gene deletion prevented PKCdelta-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression rescued the ability of PKCdelta to induce apoptosis in p53 null SMCs. We also establish that PKCdelta regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Specifically, the transcriptional regulation required p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for serine 46, did not involve MAPK. Additionally, PKCdelta, p38 MAPK, and p53 co-associate in cells under conditions favoring apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that SMC apoptosis proceeds through a pathway that involves PKCdelta, the intermediary p38 MAPK, and the downstream target tumor suppressor p53.},

abstract = {Whole-genome duplication followed by massive gene loss and specialization has long been postulated as a powerful mechanism of evolutionary innovation. Recently, it has become possible to test this notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient duplication. Here, we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient whole-genome duplication, by sequencing and analysing Kluyveromyces waltii, a related yeast species that diverged before the duplication. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication. This resolves the long-standing controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome, and makes it possible to study the fate of duplicated genes directly. Strikingly, 95{\%} of cases of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair, providing strong support for a specific model of evolution, and allowing us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions.},

Each SSE is represented by a single vector, and common spatial arrangements of vectors in a pair of proteins are detected. The method allows not only insertions and deletions of SSEs, but also topological permutations. It has a flexible target function that can be adjusted depending upon particular levels or definitions of structural similarity, and it is fast enough to allow structural comparisons for many pairs of proteins. The parameters for the target function are determined based on distributions of the geometrical variables for the spatial arrangements of the equivalent SSEs in well-known structural motifs. The obtained parameter set is tuned for detecting relatively strong structural similarity. We report several tests on examples including comparisons of known structural similarity and database searches for a target structure, and examine the results when this parameter set is used for the comparison of distantly related structures.},

Increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals.Results: With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.Conclusion: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines. {\textcopyright} 2010 Hyatt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Screening for pathogenic mutations in breast and ovarian cancer genes such as BRCA1/2, CHEK2 and RAD51C is common practice for individuals from high-risk families. However, test results may be ambiguous due to the presence of unclassified variants (UCV) in the concurrent absence of clearly cancer-predisposing mutations. Especially the presence of intronic or exonic variants within these genes that possibly affect proper pre-mRNA processing poses a challenge as their functional implications are not immediately apparent. Therefore, it appears necessary to characterize potential splicing UCV and to develop appropriate classification tools. We investigated 30 distinct BRCA1 variants, both intronic and exonic, regarding their spliceogenic potential by commonly used in silico prediction algorithms (HSF, MaxEntScan) along with in vitro transcript analyses. A total of 25 variants were identified spliceogenic, either causing/enhancing exon skipping or activation of cryptic splice sites, or both. Except from a single intronic variant causing minor effects on BRCA1 pre-mRNA processing in our analyses, 23 out of 24 intronic variants were correctly predicted by MaxEntScan, while HSF was less accurate in this cohort. Among the 6 exonic variants analyzed, 4 severely impair correct pre-mRNA processing, while the remaining two have partial effects. In contrast to the intronic alterations investigated, only half of the spliceogenic exonic variants were correctly predicted by HSF and/or MaxEntScan. These data support the idea that exonic splicing mutations are commonly disease-causing and concurrently prone to escape in silico prediction, hence necessitating experimental in vitro splicing analysis.},

@article{Pavlov2001,
abstract = {Several amino acids in the active site of family A DNA polymerases contribute to accurate DNA synthesis. For two of these residues, family B DNA polymerases have conserved tyrosine residues in regions II and III that are suggested to have similar functions. Here we replaced each tyrosine with alanine in the catalytic subunits of yeast DNA polymerases alpha, delta, epsilon, and zeta and examined the consequences in vivo. Strains with the tyrosine substitution in the conserved SL/MYPS/N motif in region II in Pol delta or Pol epsilon are inviable. Strains with same substitution in Rev3, the catalytic subunit of Pol zeta, are nearly UV immutable, suggesting severe loss of function. A strain with this substitution in Pol alpha (pol1-Y869A) is viable, but it exhibits slow growth, sensitivity to hydroxyurea, and a spontaneous mutator phenotype for frameshifts and base substitutions. The pol1-Y869A/pol1-Y869A diploid exhibits aberrant growth. Thus, this tyrosine is critical for the function of all four eukaryotic family B DNA polymerases. Strains with a tyrosine substitution in the conserved NS/VxYG motif in region III in Pol alpha, -delta, or -epsilon are viable and a strain with the homologous substitution in Rev3 is UV mutable. The Pol alpha mutant has no obvious phenotype. The Pol epsilon (pol2-Y831A) mutant is slightly sensitive to hydroxyurea and is a semidominant mutator for spontaneous base substitutions and frameshifts. The Pol delta mutant (pol3-Y708A) grows slowly, is sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate, and is a strong base substitution and frameshift mutator. The pol3-Y708A/pol3-Y708A diploid grows slowly and aberrantly. Mutation rates in the Pol alpha, -delta, and -epsilon mutant strains are increased in a locus-specific manner by inactivation of PMS1-dependent DNA mismatch repair, suggesting that the mutator effects are due to reduced fidelity of chromosomal DNA replication. This could result directly from relaxed base selectivity of the mutant polymerases due to the amino acid changes in the polymerase active site. In addition, the alanine substitutions may impair catalytic function to allow a different polymerase to compete at the replication fork. This is supported by the observation that the pol3-Y708A mutation is recessive and its mutator effect is partially suppressed by disruption of the REV3 gene.},

This method, Barcode analysis by Sequencing, or "Bar-seq," outperforms the current benchmark barcode microarray assay in terms of both dynamic range and throughput. When applied to a complex chemogenomic assay, Bar-seq quantitatively identifies drug targets, with performance superior to the benchmark microarray assay. We also show that Bar-seq is well-suited for a multiplex format. We completely re-sequenced and re-annotated the yeast deletion collection using deep sequencing, found that ∼20{\%} of the barcodes and common priming sequences varied from expectation, and used this revised list of barcode sequences to improve data quality. Together, this new assay and analysis routine provide a deep-sequencing-based toolkit for identifying gene-environment interactions on a genome-wide scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Similar observations have been made regarding the increased frequency of bone marrow and organ transplants, the use of antineoplastic agents, the excessive use of antibiotics, and the prolonged use of corticosteroids among others. In addition, several pathogenic fungi have developed resistance to current drugs. Together these have conspired to spur a need for developing new treatment options for OIs. To aid this effort, this article reviews the biological targets of current and emerging drugs and agents that act through these targets for the treatment of opportunistic fungal infections.},

When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a ROC curve. The curve is constructed by varying that cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data.

abstract = {The Tol assembly of proteins is an interacting network of proteins located in the Escherichia coli cell envelope that transduces energy and contributes to cell integrity. TolA is central to this network linking the inner and outer membranes by interactions with TolQ, TolR, TolB, and Pal. Group A colicins, such as ColA, parasitize the Tol network through interactions with TolA and/or TolB to facilitate translocation through the cell envelope to reach their cytotoxic site of action. We have determined the first structure of the C-terminal domain of TolA (TolAIII) bound to an N-terminal ColA polypeptide (TA(53-107)). The interface region of the TA(53-107)-TolAIII complex consists of polar contacts linking residues Arg-92 to Arg-96 of ColA with residues Leu-375-Pro-380 of TolA, which constitutes a $\beta$-strand addition commonly seen in more promiscuous protein-protein contacts. The interface region also includes three cation-$\pi$ interactions (Tyr-58-Lys-368, Tyr-90-Lys-379, Phe-94-Lys-396), which have not been observed in any other colicin-Tol protein complex. Mutagenesis of the interface residues of ColA or TolA revealed that the effect on the interaction was cumulative; single mutations of either partner had no effect on ColA activity, whereas mutations of three or more residues significantly reduced ColA activity. Mutagenesis of the aromatic ring component of the cation-$\pi$ interacting residues showed Tyr-58 of ColA to be essential for the stability of complex formation. TA(53-107) binds on the opposite side of TolAIII to that used by g3p, ColN, or TolB, illustrating the flexible nature of TolA as a periplasmic hub protein.},

abstract = {The advent of hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance (MR) has provided new potential for the real-time visualization of in vivo metabolic processes. The aim of this work was to use hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate as a metabolic tracer to assess noninvasively the flux through the mitochondrial enzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the rat heart, by measuring the production of bicarbonate (H(13)CO(3)(-)), a byproduct of the PDH-catalyzed conversion of [1-(13)C]pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. By noninvasively observing a 74{\%} decrease in H(13)CO(3)(-) production in fasted rats compared with fed controls, we have demonstrated that hyperpolarized (13)C MR is sensitive to physiological perturbations in PDH flux. Further, we evaluated the ability of the hyperpolarized (13)C MR technique to monitor disease progression by examining PDH flux before and 5 days after streptozotocin induction of type 1 diabetes. We detected decreased H(13)CO(3)(-) production with the onset of diabetes that correlated with disease severity. These observations were supported by in vitro investigations of PDH activity as reported in the literature and provided evidence that flux through the PDH enzyme complex can be monitored noninvasively, in vivo, by using hyperpolarized (13)C MR.},

The short life span of a sir3 or sir4 mutant is due to the simultaneous expression of a and alpha mating-type information, which indirectly causes an increase in rDNA recombination and likely increases the production of extrachromosomal rDNA circles. The short life span of a sir2 mutant also reveals a direct failure to repress recombination generated by the Fob1p-mediated replication block in the rDNA. Sir2p is a limiting component in promoting yeast longevity, and increasing the gene dosage extends the life span in wild-type cells. A possible role of the conserved SIR2 in mammalian aging is discussed.},

We also confirmed that pseudoviral production systems can give rise to notably elevated gp120 oligomannose levels (98{\%}), compared to gp120 derived from a single-plasmid viral system using the HIVLAI backbone (56{\%}). This study highlights differences in glycosylation between virion-associated and recombinant gp120.},

abstract = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93{\%}+-0.06{\%} is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8{\%} accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0{\%} accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined.},

abstract = {Inside-out activation of integrins is mediated via the binding of talin and kindlin to integrin $\beta$-subunit cytoplasmic tails. The kindlin FERM domain is interrupted by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain within its F2 subdomain. Here, we present data confirming the importance of the kindlin-1 PH domain for integrin activation and its x-ray crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 Å revealing a C-terminal second $\alpha$-helix integral to the domain but found only in the kindlin protein family. An isoform-specific salt bridge occludes the canonical phosphoinositide binding site, but molecular dynamics simulations display transient switching to an alternative open conformer. Molecular docking reveals that the opening of the pocket would enable potential ligands to bind within it. Although lipid overlay assays suggested the PH domain binds inositol monophosphates, surface plasmon resonance demonstrated weak affinities for inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(3,4,5)P(3); K(D) ∼100 $\mu$M) and no monophosphate binding. Removing the salt bridge by site-directed mutagenesis increases the PH domain affinity for Ins(3,4,5)P(3) as measured by surface plasmon resonance and enables it to bind PtdIns(3,5)P(2) on a dot-blot. Structural comparison with other PH domains suggests that the phosphate binding pocket in the kindlin-1 PH domain is more occluded than in kindlins-2 and -3 due to its salt bridge. In addition, the apparent affinity for Ins(3,4,5)P(3) is affected by the presence of PO(4) ions in the buffer. We suggest the physiological ligand of the kindlin-1 PH domain is most likely not an inositol phosphate but another phosphorylated species.},

abstract = {Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics. MetaEuk is a toolkit for high-throughput, reference-based discovery, and annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. It performs fast searches with 6-frame-translated fragments covering all possible exons and optimally combines matches into multi-exon proteins. We used a benchmark of seven diverse, annotated genomes to show that MetaEuk is highly sensitive even under conditions of low sequence similarity to the reference database. To demonstrate MetaEuk's power to discover novel eukaryotic proteins in large-scale metagenomic data, we assembled contigs from 912 samples of the Tara Oceans project. MetaEuk predicted {\textgreater}12,000,000 protein-coding genes in 8 days on ten 16-core servers. Most of the discovered proteins are highly diverged from known proteins and originate from very sparsely sampled eukaryotic supergroups. The open-source (GPLv3) MetaEuk software (https://github.com/soedinglab/metaeuk) enables large-scale eukaryotic metagenomics through reference-based, sensitive taxonomic and functional annotation.},

We have introduced a new and consistent approach to interpolate the description between the previously distinct classifications into internal and surface residues, which otherwise is found to give rise to an erratic and discontinuous behavior. Since the goal of this study is to lay out the framework and validate the concept, it focuses on Asp and Glu residues where the protein pKa values and structures are assumed to be more reliable. The new and improved implementation is evaluated and discussed; it is found to agree better with experiment than the previous implementation (in parentheses): rmsd = 0.79 (0.91) for Asp and Glu, 0.75 (0.97) for Tyr, 0.65 (0.72) for Lys, and 1.00 (1.37) for His residues. The most significant advance, however, is in reducing the number of outliers and removing unreasonable sensitivity to small structural changes that arise from classifying residues as either internal or surface.},

abstract = {The high energy demand of the brain renders it sensitive to changes in energy fuel supply and mitochondrial function. Deficits in glucose availability and mitochondrial function are well-known hallmarks of brain aging and are particularly accentuated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. As important cellular sources of H2O2, mitochondrial dysfunction is usually associated with altered redox status. Bioenergetic deficits and chronic oxidative stress are both major contributors to cognitive decline associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammatory changes, including microglial activation and production of inflammatory cytokines, are observed in neurodegenerative diseases and normal aging. The bioenergetic hypothesis advocates for sequential events from metabolic deficits to propagation of neuronal dysfunction, to aging, and to neurodegeneration, while the inflammatory hypothesis supports microglia activation as the driving force for neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that these diverse mechanisms have redox dysregulation as a common denominator and connector. An independent view of the mechanisms underlying brain aging and neurodegeneration is being replaced by one that entails multiple mechanisms coordinating and interacting with each other. This review focuses on the alterations in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses and their connection via redox regulation in normal brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. Interaction of these systems is reviewed based on basic research and clinical studies.},

abstract = {Transketolase (TK) catalyzes reactions in the Calvin cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) and produces erythrose-4-phosphate, which is a precursor for the shikimate pathway leading to phenylpropanoid metabolism. To investigate the consequences of decreased TK expression for primary and secondary metabolism, we transformed tobacco with a construct containing an antisense TK sequence. The results were as follows: (1) a 20 to 40{\%} reduction of TK activity inhibited ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration and photosynthesis. The inhibition of photosynthesis became greater as irradiance increased across the range experienced in growth conditions (170 to 700 micromol m(-2) sec(-1)). TK almost completely limited the maximum rate of photosynthesis in saturating light and saturating CO(2). (2) Decreased expression of TK led to a preferential decrease of sugars, whereas starch remained high until photosynthesis was strongly inhibited. One of the substrates of TK (fructose-6-phosphate) is the starting point for starch synthesis, and one of the products (erythrose-4-phosphate) inhibits phosphoglucose isomerase, which catalyzes the first reaction leading to starch. (3) A 20 to 50{\%} decrease of TK activity led to decreased levels of aromatic amino acids and decreased levels of the intermediates (caffeic acid and hydroxycinnamic acids) and products (chlorogenic acid, tocopherol, and lignin) of phenylpropanoid metabolism. (4) There was local loss of chlorophyll and carotene on the midrib when TK activity was inhibited by {\textgreater}50{\%}, spreading onto minor veins and lamina in severely affected transformants. (5) OPPP activity was not strongly inhibited by decreased TK activity. These results identify TK activity as an important determinant of photosynthetic and phenylpropanoid metabolism and show that the provision of precursors by primary metabolism colimits flux into the shikimate pathway and phenylpropanoid metabolism.},

Advancements were achieved through the introduction of transmissive scanning hardware and software technology, frequent acquisition of exact colony population size measurements, extraction of population growth rates from growth curves, and removal of spatial bias by reference-surface normalization. Our prototype arrangement automatically records and analyzes close to 100,000 growth curves in parallel.

Non-classical disulfide bond structure was first identified in IgG4 and later in IgG2 antibodies. Although, cysteine residues should be in the disulfide bonded states, free sulfhydryls have been detected in all subclasses of IgG antibodies. In addition, disulfide bonds are susceptible to chemical modifications, which can further generate structural variants such as IgG antibodies with trisulfide bond or thioether linkages. Trisulfide bond formation has also been observed for IgG of all subclasses. Degradation of disulfide bond through $\beta$-elimination generates free sulfhydryls disulfide and dehydroalanine. Further reaction between free sulfhydryl and dehydroalanine leads to the formation of a non-reducible cross-linked species. Hydrolysis of the dehydroalanine residue contributes substantially to antibody hinge region fragmentation. The effect of these disulfide bond variations on antibody structure, stability and biological function are discussed in this review.},

AFP can be regarded as a problem of the large-scale multi-label classification where a protein can be associated with multiple gene ontology terms as its labels. Based on our GOLabeler-a state-of-the-art method for the third critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA3), in this paper we propose NetGO, a web server that is able to further improve the performance of the large-scale AFP by incorporating massive protein-protein network information. Specifically, the advantages of NetGO are threefold in using network information: (i) NetGO relies on a powerful learning to rank framework from machine learning to effectively integrate both sequence and network information of proteins; (ii) NetGO uses the massive network information of all species ({\textgreater}2000) in STRING (other than only some specific species) and (iii) NetGO still can use network information to annotate a protein by homology transfer, even if it is not contained in STRING. Separating training and testing data with the same time-delayed settings of CAFA, we comprehensively examined the performance of NetGO. Experimental results have clearly demonstrated that NetGO significantly outperforms GOLabeler and other competing methods.

abstract = {Activation of protein kinase B (PKB) by growth factors and hormones has been demonstrated to proceed via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). In this report, we show that PKB can also be activated by PKA (cyclic AMP [cAMP]-dependent protein kinase) through a PI3-kinase-independent pathway. Although this activation required phosphorylation of PKB, PKB is not likely to be a physiological substrate of PKA since a mutation in the sole PKA consensus phosphorylation site of PKB did not abolish PKA-induced activation of PKB. In addition, mechanistically, this activation was different from that of growth factors since it did not require phosphorylation of the S473 residue, which is essential for full PKB activation induced by insulin. These data were supported by the fact that mutation of residue S473 of PKB to alanine did not prevent it from being activated by forskolin. Moreover, phosphopeptide maps of overexpressed PKB from COS cells showed differences between insulin- and forskolin-stimulated cells that pointed to distinct activation mechanisms of PKB depending on whether insulin or cAMP was used. We looked at events downstream of PKB and found that PKA activation of PKB led to the phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, a known in vivo substrate of PKB. Overexpression of a dominant negative PKB led to the loss of inhibition of GSK-3 in both insulin- and forskolin-treated cells, demonstrating that PKB was responsible for this inhibition in both cases. Finally, we show by confocal microscopy that forskolin, similar to insulin, was able to induce translocation of PKB to the plasma membrane. This process was inhibited by high concentrations of wortmannin (300 nM), suggesting that forskolin-induced PKB movement may require phospholipids, which are probably not generated by class I or class III PI3-kinase. However, high concentrations of wortmannin did not abolish PKB activation, which demonstrates that translocation per se is not important for PKA-induced PKB activation.},

Phosphorylation of histone H3 is unique in the sense that it associates on one hand with open chromatin during gene activation and marks on the other hand highly condensed chromatin during mitosis. Phosphorylation of serine residues at histone H3 is a highly dynamic process that creates together with acetylation and methylation marks at neighboring lysine residues specific combinatorial patterns that are read by specific detector proteins. In this review we describe the importance of different histone H3 phosphorylation marks for chromatin condensation during mitosis. In addition, we review the signals that trigger histone H3 phosphorylation and the factors that control this reversible modification during interphase and mediate the biological readout of the signal. Finally, we discuss different models describing the role of histone H3 phosphorylation in the activation of transcription of poised genes or by transient derepression of epigenetically silenced genes. We propose that histone H3 phosphorylation in the context with lysine methylation might temporarily relieve the silencing of specific genes without affecting the epigenetic memory.},

abstract = {We report the latest release of the CATH protein domains database. This is a hierarchical classification of 13,359 protein domain structures into evolutionary families and structural groupings. We currently identify 827 homologous families in which the proteins have both structual similarity and sequence and/or functional similarity. These can be further clustered into 593 fold groups and 32 distinct architectures. Using our structural classification and associated data on protein functions, stored in the database we have been able to analyse the correlation between the 3D structure and function. More than 96{\%} of folds in the PDB are associated with a single homologous family. However, within the superfolds, three or more different functions are observed. Considering enzyme functions, more than 95{\%} of clearly homologous families exhibit either single or closely related functions, as demonstrated by the EC identifiers of their relatives. Our analysis supports the view that determining structures, for example as part of a 'structural genomics' initiative, will make a major contribution to interpreting genome data.},

abstract = {Motivation: The challenge of template-based modeling lies in the recognition of correct templates and generation of accurate sequence-template alignments. Homologous information has proved to be very powerful in detecting remote homologs, as demonstrated by the state-of-the-art profile-based method HHpred. However, HHpred does not fare well when proteins under consideration are low-homology. A protein is low-homology if we cannot obtain sufficient amount of homologous information for it from existing protein sequence databases. Results: We present a profile-entropy dependent scoring function for low-homology protein threading. This method will model correlation among various protein features and determine their relative importance according to the amount of homologous information available. When proteins under consideration are low-homology, our method will rely more on structure information; otherwise, homologous information. Experimental results indicate that our threading method greatly outperforms the best profile-based method HHpred and all the top CASP8 servers on low-homology proteins. Tested on the CASP8 hard targets, our threading method is also better than all the top CASP8 servers but slightly worse than Zhang-Server. This is significant considering that Zhang-Server and other top CASP8 servers use a combination of multiple structure-prediction techniques including consensus method, multiple-template modeling, template-free modeling and model refinement while our method is a classical single-template-based threading method without any post-threading refinement.

Thus, genetic lesions, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, that disrupt DSB repair are often associated with cancer susceptibility. In addition, recent evidence suggests that DSB "mis-repair", in which DSBs are resolved by an inappropriate repair pathway, can also promote genomic instability and presumably tumorigenesis. This notion has gained currency from recent cancer genome sequencing studies which have uncovered numerous chromosomal rearrangements harboring pathological DNA repair signatures. In this perspective, we discuss the factors that regulate DSB repair pathway choice and their consequences for genome stability and cancer.},

abstract = {Colicins are bacterial toxins that parasitize OM (outer membrane) receptors to bind to the target cells, use an import system to translocate through the cell envelope and then kill sensitive cells. Colicins classified as group A (colicins A, E1-E9, K and N) use the Tol system (TolA, TolB, TolQ and TolR), whereas group B colicins (colicins B, D, Ia, M and 5) use the ExbB-ExbD-TonB system. Genetic evidence has suggested that TolQ and ExbB, as well as TolR and ExbD, are interchangeable, whereas this is not possible with TolA and TonB. Early reports indicated that group B colicin uptake requires energy input, whereas no energy was necessary for the uptake of the pore-forming colicin A. Furthermore, energy is required to dissociate the complex formed with colicin E9 and its cognate immunity protein during the import process. In the present paper, we detail the functional phenotypes and colicin-sensitivity results obtained in tolQ and exbB mutants and cross-complementation data of amino acid substitutions that lie within ExbB or TolQ TMHs (transmembrane helices). We also discuss on a specific phenotype that corresponds to group A colicin-sensitivity associated with a non-functional Tol system.},

About 200 of these domain families are common to all kingdoms of life and account for nearly 50{\%} of domain structure annotations in the genomes. Some of these domain families have been very extensively duplicated within a genome and combined with different domain partners giving rise to different multidomain proteins. The ways in which these domain combinations evolve tend to be specific to the organism so that less than 15{\%} of the protein families found within a genome appear to be common to all kingdoms of life.

abstract = {As large-scale re-sequencing of genomes reveals many protein mutations, especially in human cancer tissues, prediction of their likely functional impact becomes important practical goal. Here, we introduce a new functional impact score (FIS) for amino acid residue changes using evolutionary conservation patterns. The information in these patterns is derived from aligned families and sub-families of sequence homologs within and between species using combinatorial entropy formalism. The score performs well on a large set of human protein mutations in separating disease-associated variants (∼19 200), assumed to be strongly functional, from common polymorphisms (∼35 600), assumed to be weakly functional (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ∼0.86). In cancer, using recurrence, multiplicity and annotation for ∼10 000 mutations in the COSMIC database, the method does well in assigning higher scores to more likely functional mutations (‘drivers'). To guide experimental prioritization, we report a list of about 1000 top human cancer genes frequently mutated in one or more cancer types ranked by likely functional impact; and, an additional 1000 candidate cancer genes with rare but likely functional mutations. In addition, we estimate that at least 5{\%} of cancer-relevant mutations involve switch of function, rather than simply loss or gain of function.},

Formation of the translocon involved ColE9's unstructured N-terminal domain threading in opposite directions through two OmpF subunits, capturing its target TolB on the other side of the membrane in a fixed orientation that triggers colicin import. Thus, an intrinsically disordered protein can tunnel through the narrow pores of an oligomeric porin to deliver an epitope signal to the cell to initiate cell death.},

abstract = {Expression of the Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1) protein, an inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, is elevated in the brains of patients with Down syndrome (DS) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although increased levels of DSCR1 were often observed to be deleterious to neuronal health, its beneficial effects against AD neuropathology also have been reported, and the roles of DSCR1 on the pathogenesis of AD remain controversial. Here, we investigated the role of sarah (sra)/nebula, a Drosophila DSCR1 ortholog, in amyloid-$\beta$42 (A$\beta$42)-induced neurological phenotypes in Drosophila. We detected sra expression in the mushroom bodies of the fly brain, which are a center for learning and memory in flies. Moreover, similar to humans with AD, A$\beta$42-expressing flies showed increased Sra levels in the brain, demonstrating that the expression pattern of DSCR1 with regard to AD pathogenesis is conserved in Drosophila. Interestingly, overexpression of sra using the UAS-GAL4 system exacerbated the rough eye phenotype, decreased survival rates, and increased neuronal cell death in A$\beta$42-expressing flies without modulating A$\beta$42 expression. Moreover, neuronal overexpression of sra in combination with A$\beta$42 dramatically reduced both locomotor activity and the adult lifespan of A$\beta$42-expressing flies, while flies with overexpression of sra alone showed normal climbing ability albeit with a slightly reduced lifespan. Similarly, treatment with chemical inhibitors of calcineurin such as FK506 and cyclosporin A, or knockdown of calcineurin expression by RNAi, exacerbated the A$\beta$42-induced rough eye phenotype. Furthermore, sra-overexpressing flies displayed significantly decreased mitochondrial DNA and ATP levels, as well as increased susceptibility to oxidative stress compared to that of control flies. Taken together, our results demonstrating that sra overexpression augments A$\beta$42 cytotoxicity in Drosophila suggest that DSCR1 up-regulation or calcineurin down-regulation in the brain may exacerbate A$\beta$42-associated neuropathogenesis in AD or DS.},

abstract = {This review investigates some key aspects of transport mechanisms and recent advances in our understanding of this ubiquitous cellular process. The prevailing model of cotransport is the alternating access model, which suggests that large conformational changes in the transporter protein accompany cotransport. This model rests on decades of research and has received substantial support because many transporter characteristics are explained using its premises. New experiments, however, have revealed the existence of channels in transporters, an idea that is in conflict with traditional models. The alternating access model is the subject of previous detailed reviews. Here we concentrate on the relatively recent data that document primarily the channel properties of transporters. In some cases, namely, the observation of single-transporter currents, the evidence is direct. In other cases the evidence--for example, from fluctuation analysis or transporter currents too large to be described as anything other than channel-like--is indirect. Although the existence of channels in transporters is not in doubt, we are far from understanding the significance of this property. In the online Supplemental Material , we review some pertinent aspects of ion channel theory and cotransport physiology to provide background for the channels and transporters presented here. We discuss the existence of channels in transporters, and we speculate on the biological significance of this newly unveiled property of transport proteins.},

In natural settings, microbes are typically in polymicrobial communities and antibiotic-mediated interactions between species may play a significant role in bacterial community structure and function. However, these aspects have not yet fully been explored at the community level. Here we discuss the different types of interactions mediated by antibiotics and non-antibiotic metabolites as a function of their concentrations and speculate on how these may amplify the overall antibiotic resistance/tolerance and the spread of antibiotic resistance determinants in a context of polymicrobial community. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bernier and Surette.},

As demonstrated by Western blot and time-resolved immunofluorescence assays the antibodies are pan-specific for most or all of the Gla-containing proteins tested (factors VII, IX, and X, prothrombin, protein C, protein S, growth arrest-specific protein 6, bone Gla protein, conantokin G from a cone snail, and factor Xa-like proteins from snake venom). Only the Gla-containing light chain of the two-chain proteins was bound. Decarboxylation destroyed the epitope(s) on prothrombin fragment 1, and Ca(2+) strongly inhibited binding to prothrombin. In Western blot, immunofluorescence, and surface plasmon resonance assays the antibodies bound peptides conjugated to bovine serum albumin that contained either a single Gla or a tandem pair of Gla residues. Binding was maintained when the sequence surrounding the Gla residue(s) was altered. Replacement of Gla with glutamic acid resulted in a complete loss of the epitope. The utility of the antibodies was demonstrated in immunochemical methods for detecting Gla-containing proteins and in the immunopurification of a factor Xa-like protein from tiger snake venom. The amino acid sequences of the Gla domain and portions of the heavy chain of the snake protein were determined.},

abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates.},

In Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a mutant form of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A distorts nuclei and sequesters nuclear proteins. We sought to investigate protein homeostasis in this disease. Here, we report a widespread increase in protein turnover in HGPS-derived cells compared to normal cells. We determine that global protein synthesis is elevated as a consequence of activated nucleoli and enhanced ribosome biogenesis in HGPS-derived fibroblasts. Depleting normal lamin A or inducing mutant lamin A expression are each sufficient to drive nucleolar expansion. We further show that nucleolar size correlates with donor age in primary fibroblasts derived from healthy individuals and that ribosomal RNA production increases with age, indicating that nucleolar size and activity can serve as aging biomarkers. While limiting ribosome biogenesis extends lifespan in several systems, we show that increased ribosome biogenesis and activity are a hallmark of premature aging.},

abstract = {Two-component systems (TCSs) are important for the adaptation and survival of bacteria and fungi under stress conditions. A TCS is often composed of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a response regulator (RR), which are relayed through sequential phosphorylation steps. However, the mechanism for how an SK is switched on in response to environmental stimuli remains obscure. Here, we report the crystal structure of a complete cytoplasmic portion of an SK, VicK from Streptococcus mutans. The overall structure of VicK is a long-rod dimer that anchors four connected domains: HAMP, Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS), DHp, and catalytic and ATP binding domain (CA). The HAMP, a signal transducer, and the PAS domain, major sensor, adopt canonical folds with dyad symmetry. In contrast, the dimer of the DHp and CA domains is asymmetric because of different helical bends in the DHp domain and spatial positions of the CA domains. Moreover, a conserved proline, which is adjacent to the phosphoryl acceptor histidine, contributes to helical bending, which is essential for the autokinase and phosphatase activities. Together, the elegant architecture of VicK with a signal transducer and sensor domain suggests a model where DHp helical bending and a CA swing movement are likely coordinated for autokinase activation.},

Its detailed descriptions of clinical abnormalities and computable disease definitions have made HPO the de facto standard for deep phenotyping in the field of rare disease. The HPO's interoperability with other ontologies has enabled it to be used to improve diagnostic accuracy by incorporating model organism data. It also plays a key role in the popular Exomiser tool, which identifies potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data. Since the HPO was first introduced in 2008, its users have become both more numerous and more diverse. To meet these emerging needs, the project has added new content, language translations, mappings and computational tooling, as well as integrations with external community data. The HPO continues to collaborate with clinical adopters to improve specific areas of the ontology and extend standardized disease descriptions. The newly redesigned HPO website (www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) simplifies browsing terms and exploring clinical features, diseases, and human genes.},

abstract = {The observation that disease associated proteins often interact with each other has fueled the development of network-based approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of human disease. Such approaches build on the assumption that protein interaction networks can be viewed as maps in which diseases can be identified with localized perturbation within a certain neighborhood. The identification of these neighborhoods, or disease modules, is therefore a prerequisite of a detailed investigation of a particular pathophenotype. While numerous heuristic methods exist that successfully pinpoint disease associated modules, the basic underlying connectivity patterns remain largely unexplored. In this work we aim to fill this gap by analyzing the network properties of a comprehensive corpus of 70 complex diseases. We find that disease associated proteins do not reside within locally dense communities and instead identify connectivity significance as the most predictive quantity. This quantity inspires the design of a novel Disease Module Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm to identify the full disease module around a set of known disease proteins. We study the performance of the algorithm using well-controlled synthetic data and systematically validate the identified neighborhoods for a large corpus of diseases.},

Over the past 40 years, the use of both drugs has risen significantly with differential consequences. It is argued that increased policing of cannabis use under the current drug classification system will lead to increased criminalization of young people, but is unlikely to significantly reduce the rates of schizophrenia and psychosis. In comparison, increases in alcohol drinking are related to significant increases in liver cirrhosis hospital admissions and mortality, at a time when mortality rates from other major causes are on the decline. A recent expert-led comparison of the health and social harms to the user and to others caused by the most commonly used drugs in the UK showed alcohol to be more than twice as harmful as cannabis to users, and five times as harmful as cannabis to others. The findings underline the need for a coherent, evidence-based drugs policy that enables individuals to make informed decisions about the consequences of their drug use.},

High rates of pol III transcription are necessary for cells to sustain growth. A wide range of transformed and tumour cell types have been shown to express elevated levels of pol III products. This review will summarize what is known about the mechanisms responsible for this deregulation. Some transforming agents have been shown to stimulate expression of the pol III-specific transcription factors TFIIIB or TFIIIC2. In addition, TFIIIB is bound and activated by several oncogenic proteins, including c-Myc. Conversely, TFIIIB interacts in healthy cells with the tumour suppressors RB and p53. Indeed, the ability to limit pol III transcription through TFIIIB may contribute to their growth-suppression capacities. The function of p53 and/or RB is compromised in most if not all transformed cells; the resultant derepression of TFIIIB may provide an almost universal route to deregulate pol III transcription in cancers. In addition to effects on protein synthesis and growth, there is a precedent for a pol III product having oncogenic activity.},

Although its mode of action is unorthodox, Im9 is a remarkably effective inhibitor since it folds within milliseconds and then associates with its target endonuclease at the rate of diffusion to form an inactive complex with sub-femtomolar binding affinity. This hyperefficient mechanism of inhibition could be well suited to other toxic enzyme systems, particularly where the substrate is a polymer extending beyond the boundaries of the active site.},

abstract = {The field of ecology has long recognized two types of competition: exploitative competition, which occurs indirectly through resource consumption, and interference competition, whereby one individual directly harms another. Here, we argue that these two forms of competition have played a dominant role in the evolution of bacterial regulatory networks. In particular, we argue that several of the major bacterial stress responses detect ecological competition by sensing nutrient limitation (exploitative competition) or direct cell damage (interference competition). We call this competition sensing: a physiological response that detects harm caused by other cells and that evolved, at least in part, for that purpose. A key prediction of our hypothesis is that bacteria will counter-attack when they sense ecological competition but not when they sense abiotic stress. In support of this hypothesis, we show that bacteriocins and antibiotics are frequently upregulated by stress responses to nutrient limitation and cell damage but very rarely upregulated by stress responses to heat or osmotic stress, which typically are not competition related. We argue that stress responses, in combination with the various mechanisms that sense secretions, enable bacteria to infer the presence of ecological competition and navigate the 'microbe-kill-microbe' world in which they live.},

abstract = {FACT is a roughly 180kDa heterodimeric protein complex important for managing the properties of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Chromatin is a repressive barrier that plays an important role in protecting genomic DNA and regulating access to it. This barrier must be temporarily removed during transcription, replication, and repair, but it also must be rapidly restored to the original state afterwards. Further, the properties of chromatin are dynamic and must be adjusted as conditions dictate. FACT was identified as a factor that destabilizes nucleosomes in vitro, but it has now also been implicated as a central factor in the deposition of histones to form nucleosomes, as an exchange factor that swaps the histones within existing nucleosomes for variant forms, and as a tether that prevents histones from being displaced by the passage of RNA polymerases during transcription. FACT therefore plays central roles in building, maintaining, adjusting, and overcoming the chromatin barrier. This review summarizes recent results that have begun to reveal how FACT can promote what appear to be contradictory goals, using a simple set of binding activities to both enhance and diminish the stability of nucleosomes.

abstract = {Aging in mammals is accompanied by a progressive atrophy of tissues and organs, and stochastic damage accumulation to the macromolecules DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. The sequence of the human genome represents our genetic blueprint, and accumulating evidence suggests that loss of genomic maintenance may causally contribute to aging. Distinct evidence for a role of imperfect DNA repair in aging is that several premature aging syndromes have underlying genetic DNA repair defects. Accumulation of DNA damage may be particularly prevalent in the central nervous system owing to the low DNA repair capacity in postmitotic brain tissue. It is generally believed that the cumulative effects of the deleterious changes that occur in aging, mostly after the reproductive phase, contribute to species-specific rates of aging. In addition to nuclear DNA damage contributions to aging, there is also abundant evidence for a causative link between mitochondrial DNA damage and the major phenotypes associated with aging. Understanding the mechanistic basis for the association of DNA damage and DNA repair with aging and age-related diseases, such as neurodegeneration, would give insight into contravening age-related diseases and promoting a healthy life span.},

We report here that C3 activation also occurred intracellularly. We found that the T cell-expressed protease cathepsin L (CTSL) processed C3 into biologically active C3a and C3b. Resting T cells contained stores of endosomal and lysosomal C3 and CTSL and substantial amounts of CTSL-generated C3a. While "tonic" intracellular C3a generation was required for homeostatic T cell survival, shuttling of this intracellular C3-activation-system to the cell surface upon T cell stimulation induced autocrine proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, T cells from patients with autoimmune arthritis demonstrated hyperactive intracellular complement activation and interferon-$\gamma$ production and CTSL inhibition corrected this deregulated phenotype. Importantly, intracellular C3a was observed in all examined cell populations, suggesting that intracellular complement activation might be of broad physiological significance.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na(+) channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 {\AA} resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 {\AA} wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.},

abstract = {Several large ongoing initiatives that profit from next-generation sequencing technologies have driven--and in coming years will continue to drive--the emergence of long catalogs of missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human genome. As a consequence, researchers have developed various methods and their related computational tools to classify these missense SNVs as probably deleterious or probably neutral polymorphisms. The outputs produced by each of these computational tools are of different natures and thus difficult to compare and integrate. Taking advantage of the possible complementarity between different tools might allow more accurate classifications. Here we propose an effective approach to integrating the output of some of these tools into a unified classification; this approach is based on a weighted average of the normalized scores of the individual methods (WAS). (In this paper, the approach is illustrated for the integration of five tools.) We show that this WAS outperforms each individual method in the task of classifying missense SNVs as deleterious or neutral. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this WAS can be used not only for classification purposes (deleterious versus neutral mutation) but also as an indicator of the impact of the mutation on the functionality of the mutant protein. In other words, it may be used as a deleteriousness score of missense SNVs. Therefore, we recommend the use of this WAS as a consensus deleteriousness score of missense mutations (Condel).},

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {Motivation: It has been recognized that the topology of molecular networks provides information about the certainty and nature of individual interactions. Thus, network motifs have been used for predicting missing links in biological networks and for removing false positives. However, various different measures can be inferred from the structure of a given network and their predictive power varies depending on the task at hand.Results: Herein, we present a systematic assessment of seven different network features extracted from the topology of functional genetic networks and we quantify their ability to classify interactions into different types of physical protein associations. Using machine learning, we combine features based on network topology with non-network features and compare their importance of the classification of interactions. We demonstrate the utility of network features based on human and budding yeast networks; we show that network features can distinguish different sub-types of physical protein associations and we apply the framework to fission yeast, which has a much sparser known physical interactome than the other two species. Our analysis shows that network features are at least as predictive for the tasks we tested as non-network features. However, feature importance varies between species owing to different topological characteristics of the networks. The application to fission yeast shows that small maps of physical interactomes can be extended based on functional networks, which are often more readily available. {\textcopyright} The Author (2012).

abstract = {Ischemic stroke, still lacking an effective neuroprotective therapy is the third leading cause of global mortality and morbidity. Here, we have applied an 8-plex iTRAQ-based 2D-LC-MS/MS strategy to study the commonly regulated infarct proteome from three different brain regions (putamen, thalamus and the parietal lobe) of female Japanese patients. Infarcts were compared with age-, post-mortem interval- and location-matched control specimens.The iTRAQ experiment confidently identified 1520 proteins with 0.1{\%} false discovery rate. Bioinformatics data mining and immunochemical validation of pivotal perturbed proteins revealed a global failure of the cellular energy metabolism in the infarcted tissues as seen by the parallel down-regulation of proteins related to glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The concomitant down-regulation of all participating proteins (SLC25A11, SLC25A12, GOT2 and MDH2) of malate-aspartate shuttle might be responsible for the metabolic in-coordination between the cytosol and mitochondria resulting in the failure of energy metabolism. The levels of proteins related to reactive gliosis (VIM, GFAP) and anti-inflammatory response (ANXA1, ANXA2) showed an increasing trend. The elevation of ferritin (FTL, FTH1) may indicate an iron-mediated oxidative imbalance aggravating the mitochondrial failure and neurotoxicity. The deregulated proteins could be useful as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for ischemic stroke. Biological significance: Clinical proteomics of stroke has been lagging behind other areas of clinical proteomics like Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. Our study is the first quantitative clinical proteomics study where iTRAQ-2D-LC-MS/MS has been utilized in the area of ischemic stroke to obtain a comparative profile of human ischemic infarcts and age-, sex-, location- and post-mortem interval-matched control brain specimens. Different pathological attributes of ischemic stroke well-known through basic and pre-clinical research such as failure of cellular energy metabolism, reactive gliosis, activation of anti-inflammatory response and aberrant iron metabolism have been observed at the bedside. Our dataset could act as a reference for similar studies done in the future using ischemic brain samples from various brain banks across the world. A meta-analysis of these studies could help to map the pathological proteome specific to ischemic stroke that will guide the scientific community to better evaluate the pros and cons of the pre-clinical models for efficacy and mechanistic studies.Infarct being the core of injury should have the most intense regulation for several key proteins involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Hence, a part of the up-regulated proteome could leak into the general circulation that may offer candidates of interest as potential biomarkers. In support of our proposed hypothesis, we report ferritin in the current study as one of the most elevated proteins in the infarct, which has been documented as a biomarker in the context of ischemic stroke by an independent study. Overall, our approach has the potential to identify probable therapeutic targets and biomarkers in the area of ischemic stroke. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We developed a rigorous network comparison framework that accounts for assay sensitivity and specificity, revealing extensive species-specific network rewiring between fission yeast, budding yeast, and human. Surprisingly, although genes are better conserved between the yeasts, S. pombe interactions are significantly better conserved in human than in S. cerevisiae. Our framework also reveals that different modes of gene duplication influence the extent to which paralogous proteins are functionally repurposed. Finally, cross-species interactome mapping demonstrates that coevolution of interacting proteins is remarkably prevalent, a result with important implications for studying human disease in model organisms.

However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods.

RESULTS: We made 10 single nucleotide polymorphism and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15 kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200 kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself.

Here we benchmark the coverage and error rate of genome annotation using the widely used homology-searching program PSI-BLAST (position-specific iterated basic local alignment search tool). This study evaluates the one-to-many success rate for recognition, as often there are several homologues in the database and only one needs to be identified for annotating the sequence. In contrast, previous benchmarks considered one-to-one recognition in which a single query was required to find a particular target. The benchmark constructs a model genome from the full sequences of the structural classification of protein (SCOP) database and searches against a target library of remote homologous domains ({\textless} 20{\%} identity). The structural benchmark provides a reliable list of correct and false homology assignments. PSI-BLAST successfully annotated 40{\%} of the domains in the model genome that had at least one homologue in the target library. This coverage is more than three times that if one-to-one recognition is evaluated (11{\%} coverage of domains). Although a structural benchmark was used, the results equally apply to just sequence homology searches. Accordingly, structural and sequence assignments were made to the sequences of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (see http://www.bmm.icnet.uk). The extent of missed assignments and of new superfamilies can be estimated for these genomes for both structural and functional annotations.},

The hijacking of inter-organelle vesicular trafficking through the targeting of small GTPases or SNARE proteins has been well established. Here, we show that intracellular pathogens also establish direct membrane contact sites with organelles and exploit non-vesicular transport machinery. We identified the ER-to-Golgi ceramide transfer protein CERT as a host cell factor specifically recruited to the inclusion, a membrane-bound compartment harboring the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. We further showed that CERT recruitment to the inclusion correlated with the recruitment of VAPA/B-positive tubules in close proximity of the inclusion membrane, suggesting that ER-Inclusion membrane contact sites are formed upon C. trachomatis infection. Moreover, we identified the C. trachomatis effector protein IncD as a specific binding partner for CERT. Finally we showed that depletion of either CERT or the VAP proteins impaired bacterial development. We propose that the presence of IncD, CERT, VAPA/B, and potentially additional host and/or bacterial factors, at points of contact between the ER and the inclusion membrane provides a specialized metabolic and/or signaling microenvironment favorable to bacterial development.},

Given the complex choreography of the substrate through the secretion apparatus, the molecular mechanism of the type IV secretion system has proved difficult to dissect in the absence of structural data for the entire machinery. Here we use electron microscopy to reconstruct the type IV secretion system encoded by the Escherichia coli R388 conjugative plasmid. We show that eight proteins assemble in an intricate stoichiometric relationship to form an approximately 3 megadalton nanomachine that spans the entire cell envelope. The structure comprises an outer membrane-associated core complex connected by a central stalk to a substantial inner membrane complex that is dominated by a battery of 12 VirB4 ATPase subunits organized as side-by-side hexameric barrels. Our results show a secretion system with markedly different architecture, and consequently mechanism, to other known bacterial secretion systems.},

SV40 large tumor antigen (LTag) is the initiator/helicase that is essential for genome replication. LTag recognizes and assembles at the viral replication origin. We determined the structure of two multidomain LTag subunits bound to origin DNA. The structure reveals that the origin binding domains (OBDs) and Zn and AAA+ domains are involved in origin recognition and assembly. Notably, the OBDs recognize the origin in an unexpected manner. The histidine residues of the AAA+ domains insert into a narrow minor groove region with enhanced negative electrostatic potential. Computational analysis indicates that this region is intrinsically narrow, demonstrating the role of DNA shape readout in origin recognition. Our results provide important insights into the assembly of the LTag initiator/helicase at the replication origin and suggest that histidine contacts with the minor groove serve as a mechanism of DNA shape readout.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {EuGene is an integrative gene finder applicable to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. EuGene annotated its first genome in 1999. Starting from genomic DNA sequences representing a complete genome, EuGene is able to predict the major transcript units in the genome from a variety of sources of information: Statistical information, similarities with known transcripts and proteins, but also any GFF3 structured information supporting the presence or absence of specific types of elements. EuGene has been used to find genes in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Theobroma cacao; tomato, sunflower, and Rosa genomes; and in the nematode Meloidogyne incognita genome, among many others. The large fraction of plant in this list probably influenced EuGene development, especially in its capacities to withstand a genome with a large number of repeated regions and transposable elements. Depending on the sources of information used for prediction, EuGene can be considered as purely ab initio, purely similarity based, or hybrid. With the general availability of NGS-transcribed sequence data in genome projects, EuGene adopts a default hybrid behavior that strongly relies on similarity information. Initially targeted at eukaryotic genomes, EuGene has also been extended to offer integrative gene prediction for bacteria, allowing for richer and robust predictions than either purely statistical or homology-based prokaryotic gene finders. This text has been written as a practical guide that will give you the capacity to train and execute EuGene on your favorite eukaryotic genome. As the prokaryotic case is simpler and has already been described, only the main differences with the eukaryotic version were reported.},

By following a discrete population of these two proteins through the cell cycle, the following information was obtained. RB, which is wholly unphosphorylated in G1, became phosphorylated at the beginning of S and remained phosphorylated through S and G2. RB was, then, completely dephosphorylated between the end of G2 and the beginning of G1. Second, while all of the detectable unphosphorylated RB can be found complexed with T, these complexes present during G1 dissociated in S and reformed again in M or early G1. Finally, T molecules appeared to oligomerize prior to binding RB. Thus, complex formation between T and RB may be regulated in part by the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RB and by the quaternary structure of T.},

abstract = {The ability to obtain rapidly genetic sequence information will change biology and its applications profoundly. Soon we will have full sequence information for humans as well as a wide variety of microbes, plants, and animals. The primary problem in the life sciences will be to use this information intelligentlysto be able to relate genes to complex, biological function. The engineer's tools of synthesis and systems integration will become important components of biological discovery. For the purposes of this discussion, I define "genomics" as the set of experimental and computational tools which allow the genetic blueprints of life to be read. "Functional genomics" is the process of relating genetic blueprints to the structure and behavior of organisms. The authors of the papers in this special section provide us a variety of engineering perspectives on the development of genomic tools and their applications. Bernhard Palsson's group provides two insightful articles that review trends on the conversion of genomic information into computational descriptions of metabolic geneotype and phenotype. Schilling, Edwards, and Palsson highlight the use of the flux balance analysis as guiding methodology for the analysis of genomic data and cellular networks. They introduce the term "phenomics" to describe the interpretation and prediction of the genotype-phenotype relationship from genomic data. Schilling, Schuster, Palsson, and Heinrich review the increasing importance of metabolic pathway analysis in an era of abundant genomic data and its implication for rational metabolic engineering. These approaches are relatively mature and can provide useful guidance for near term applications. The limitation of the above approaches is that they provide no insight into dynamic responses. Kao reviews the emerging technologies for the analysis in parallel of thousands of genes. These techniques provide direct measurements on which genes are active in response to various stresses and, thus, insight into cellular dynamics. They also allow evaluation of genome-altering experiments. Such approaches provide a basis for building integrated models of cellular processes and for applications such as rapid development of improved fermentation processes. Hatzimanikatis, Choe, and Lee provide an example of the integration of the experimental tools and mathematical models. They demonstrate the importance of monitoring both transcription (mRNA) and translation (protein). While the development of tools to monitor transcription are rather well-developed (see Kao), proteomics (or measurement of the protein content of a cell or organism) is in a more primitive stage. Engineering approaches to increase throughput and accuracy of proteomic methods are urgently needed. Hatzimanikatis et al. propose a theoretical framework to incorporate m-RNA and protein data into models that relate linear genetic sequence information to the nonlinear, dynamic response of living cells. Many engineering challenges must be surmounted to make such a framework a broadly useful tool. "Functional genomics" will underlie both a better understanding of cellular function and a more efficient application of biotechnology. The engineer's ability to relate component parts to a functioning system is essential to making functional genomics a reality.},

abstract = {Nuclease colicins bind their target receptor BtuB in the outer membrane of sensitive Escherichia coli cells in the form of a high-affinity complex with their cognate immunity proteins. The release of the immunity protein from the colicin complex is a prerequisite for cell entry of the colicin and occurs via a process that is still relatively poorly understood. We have previously shown that an energy input in the form of the cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force is required to promote immunity protein (Im9) release from the colicin E9/Im9 complex and colicin cell entry. We report here that engineering rigidity in the structured part of the colicin translocation domain via the introduction of disulfide bonds prevents immunity protein release from the colicin complex. Reduction of the disulfide bond by the addition of DTT leads to immunity protein release and resumption of activity. Similarly, the introduction of a disulfide bond in the DNase domain previously shown to abolish channel formation in planar bilayers also prevented immunity protein release. Importantly, all disulfide bonds, in the translocation as well as the DNase domain, also abolished the biological activity of the Im9-free colicin E9, the reduction of which led to a resumption of activity. Our results show, for the first time, that conformational flexibility in the structured translocation and DNase domains of a nuclease colicin is essential for immunity protein release, providing further evidence for the hypothesis that global structural rearrangement of the colicin molecule is required for disassembly of this high-affinity toxin-immunity protein complex prior to outer membrane translocation.},

abstract = {We investigated the pathophysiology of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) in Drosophila melanogaster by inactivation or overexpression of the NF1 gene. NF1 gene mutants had shortened life spans and increased vulnerability to heat and oxidative stress in association with reduced mitochondrial respiration and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Flies overexpressing NF1 had increased life spans, improved reproductive fitness, increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress in association with increased mitochondrial respiration and a 60{\%} reduction in ROS production. These phenotypic effects proved to be modulated by the adenylyl cyclase/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A pathway, not the Ras/Raf pathway. Treatment of wild-type D. melanogaster with cAMP analogs increased their life span, and treatment of NF1 mutants with metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant compounds restored their life span. Thus, neurofibromin regulates longevity and stress resistance through cAMP regulation of mitochondrial respiration and ROS production, and NF1 may be treatable using catalytic antioxidants.},

abstract = {Integrin activation is crucial for numerous cellular responses, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival. Recent studies in mice have specifically emphasized the vital role of kindlin-3 in integrin activation. Kindlin-3 deficiency in humans also has now been documented and includes symptoms of bleeding, frequent infections, and osteopetrosis, which are consequences of an inability to activate beta1, beta2, and beta3 integrins. To date, kindlin-3 was thought to be restricted to hematopoietic cells. In this article, we demonstrate that kindlin-3 is present in human endothelial cells derived from various anatomical origins. The mRNA and protein for KINDLIN-3 was detected in endothelial cells by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blots. When subjected to sequencing by mass spectrometry, the protein was identified as authentic kindlin-3 and unequivocally distinguished from KINDLIN-1 and KINDLIN-2 or any other known protein. By quantitative real time PCR, the level of kindlin-3 in endothelial cells was 20-50{\%} of that of kindlin-2. Using knockdown approaches, we show that kindlin-3 plays a role in integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells. This function depends upon the integrin and substrate and is distinct from that of kindlin-2. Formation of tube-like structures in Matrigel also was impaired by kindlin-3 knockdown. Mechanistically, the distinct functions of the kindlins can be traced to differences in their subcellular localization in integrin-containing adhesion structures. Thus, the prevailing view that individual kindlins exert their functions in a cell type-specific manner must now be modified to consider distinct functions of the different family members within the same cell type.},

abstract = {The cis-trans isomerization of proline serves as a regulatory switch in signaling pathways. We identify the proline isomerase Fpr4, a member of the FK506 binding protein family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an enzyme which binds the amino-terminal tail of histones H3 and H4 and catalyses the isomerization of H3 proline P30 and P38 in vitro. We show that P38 is necessary for methylation of K36 and that isomerization by Fpr4 inhibits the ability of Set2 to methylate H3 K36 in vitro. These results suggest that the conformational state of P38, controlled by Fpr4, is important for methylation of H3K36 by Set2. Consistent with such an antagonistic role, abrogation of Fpr4 catalytic activity in vivo results in increased levels of H3K36 methylation and delayed transcriptional induction kinetics of specific genes in yeast. These results identify proline isomerization as a novel noncovalent histone modification that regulates transcription and provides evidence for crosstalk between histone lysine methylation and proline isomerization.},

@article{Brohee2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein interactions are crucial components of all cellular processes. Recently, high-throughput methods have been developed to obtain a global description of the interactome (the whole network of protein interactions for a given organism). In 2002, the yeast interactome was estimated to contain up to 80,000 potential interactions. This estimate is based on the integration of data sets obtained by various methods (mass spectrometry, two-hybrid methods, genetic studies). High-throughput methods are known, however, to yield a non-negligible rate of false positives, and to miss a fraction of existing interactions. The interactome can be represented as a graph where nodes correspond with proteins and edges with pairwise interactions. In recent years clustering methods have been developed and applied in order to extract relevant modules from such graphs. These algorithms require the specification of parameters that may drastically affect the results. In this paper we present a comparative assessment of four algorithms: Markov Clustering (MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Super Paramagnetic Clustering (SPC), and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE). RESULTS: A test graph was built on the basis of 220 complexes annotated in the MIPS database. To evaluate the robustness to false positives and false negatives, we derived 41 altered graphs by randomly removing edges from or adding edges to the test graph in various proportions. Each clustering algorithm was applied to these graphs with various parameter settings, and the clusters were compared with the annotated complexes. We analyzed the sensitivity of the algorithms to the parameters and determined their optimal parameter values. We also evaluated their robustness to alterations of the test graph. We then applied the four algorithms to six graphs obtained from high-throughput experiments and compared the resulting clusters with the annotated complexes. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that MCL is remarkably robust to graph alterations. In the tests of robustness, RNSC is more sensitive to edge deletion but less sensitive to the use of suboptimal parameter values. The other two algorithms are clearly weaker under most conditions. The analysis of high-throughput data supports the superiority of MCL for the extraction of complexes from interaction networks.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by the accumulation of the $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) within the brain along with hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Genetic, biochemical, and behavioral research suggest that physiologic generation of the neurotoxic A$\beta$ peptide from sequential amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is the crucial step in the development of AD. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain and metabolized in a rapid and highly complex fashion by a series of sequential proteases, including the intramembranous $\gamma$-secretase complex, which also process other key regulatory molecules. Why A$\beta$ accumulates in the brains of elderly individuals is unclear but could relate to changes in APP metabolism or A$\beta$ elimination. Lessons learned from biochemical and genetic studies of APP processing will be crucial to the development of therapeutic targets to treat AD.

Gene therapy using wild-type p53, delivered by adenovirus vectors, is now in widespread use in China. Other biologic approaches include the development of oncolytic viruses designed to replicate and kill only p53 defective cells and also the development of siRNA and antisense RNA's that activate p53 by inhibiting the function of the negative regulators Mdm2, MdmX, and HPV E6. The altered processing of p53 that occurs in tumor cells can elicit T-cell and B-cell responses to p53 that could be effective in eliminating cancer cells and p53 based vaccines are now in clinical trial. A number of small molecules that directly or indirectly activate the p53 response have also reached the clinic, of which the most advanced are the p53 mdm2 interaction inhibitors. Increased understanding of the p53 response is also allowing the development of powerful drug combinations that may increase the selectivity and safety of chemotherapy, by selective protection of normal cells and tissues.},

abstract = {TP53 encodes p53, which is a nuclear phosphoprotein with cancer-inhibiting properties. In response to DNA damage, p53 is activated and mediates a set of antiproliferative responses including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mutations in the TP53 gene are associated with more than 50{\%} of human cancers, and 90{\%} of these affect p53-DNA interactions, resulting in a partial or complete loss of transactivation functions. These mutations affect the structural integrity and/or p53-DNA interactions, leading to the partial or complete loss of the protein's function. We report here the results of a systematic automated analysis of the effects of p53 mutations on the structure of the core domain of the protein. We found that 304 of the 882 (34.4{\%}) distinct mutations reported in the core domain can be explained in structural terms by their predicted effects on protein folding or on protein-DNA contacts. The proportion of "explained" mutations increased to 55.6{\%} when substitutions of evolutionary conserved amino acids were included. The automated method of structural analysis developed here may be applied to other frequently mutated gene mutations such as dystrophin, BRCA1, and G6PD. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In this work, we track the in vivo secretion path of the Bordetella pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), the substrate of the model TpsB transporter FhaC, using site-specific crosslinking. The conserved secretion domain of FHA interacts with the POTRA domains, specific extracellular loops and strands of FhaC and the inner $\beta$-barrel surface. The interaction map indicates a funnel-like pathway, with conformationally flexible FHA entering the channel in a non-exclusive manner and exiting along a four-stranded $\beta$-sheet at the surface of the FhaC barrel. This sheet of FhaC guides the secretion domain of FHA along discrete steps of translocation and folding. This work demonstrates that the Omp85 barrel serves as a channel for translocation of substrate proteins.},

Surprisingly, Sod2(+/-)Gpx1(-/-) mice showed no reduction in life span, despite increased levels of oxidative damage. Consistent with the important role for oxidative stress in tumorigenesis during aging, the incidence of neoplasms was significantly increased in the older Sod2(+/-)Gpx1(-/-) mice (28-30 months).

We show that these three hallmarks of AD conflict with the amyloid hypothesis, but are consistent with the Inverse Warburg hypothesis, a bioenergetic model which postulates that AD is the result of a cascade of three events-mitochondrial dysregulation, metabolic reprogramming (the Inverse Warburg effect), and natural selection. We also provide an explanation for the failures of the clinical trials based on amyloid immunization, and we propose a new class of therapeutic strategies consistent with the neuroenergetic selection model.},

Efforts towards developing effective treatments for these disorders have shown limited efficacy at best, with no true cure to this day being present. Recent work, both clinical and experimental, indicates that many neurodegenerative disorders often display a coexisting metabolic dysfunction which may exacerbate neurological symptoms. It stands to reason therefore that metabolic pathways may themselves contain promising therapeutic targets for major neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of some of the most recent evidence for metabolic dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease, and discuss several potential mechanisms that may underlie the potential relationships between metabolic dysfunction and etiology of nervous system degeneration. We also highlight some prominent signaling pathways involved in the link between peripheral metabolism and the central nervous system that are potential targets for future therapies, and we will review some of the clinical progress in this field. It is likely that in the near future, therapeutics with combinatorial neuroprotective and 'eumetabolic' activities may possess superior efficacies compared to less pluripotent remedies.},

abstract = {The negative elongation factor NELF is a key component of an early elongation checkpoint generally located within 100 bp of the transcription start site of protein-coding genes. Negotiation of this checkpoint and conversion to productive elongation require phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (pol II), NELF, and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). P-TEFb is dispensable for transcription of the noncoding U2 snRNA genes, suggesting that a NELF-dependent checkpoint is absent. However, we find that NELF at the end of the 800-bp U2 gene transcription unit and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NELF causes a termination defect. NELF is also associated 800 bp downstream of the transcription start site of the beta-actin gene, where a "late" P-TEFb-dependent checkpoint occurs. Interestingly, both genes have an extended nucleosome-depleted region up to the NELF-dependent control point. In both cases, transcription through this region is P-TEFb independent, implicating chromatin in the formation of the terminator/checkpoint. Furthermore, CTCF colocalizes with NELF on the U2 and beta-actin genes, raising the possibility that it helps the positioning and/or function of the NELF-dependent control point on these genes.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Bacteriophage P22 is believed to contain a total of 521 copies of 9 different proteins and a 41,724 base pair genome. Despite its enormous size and complexity, phage P22 can be electrosprayed, and it remains intact in ultra-high vacuum where its molar mass distribution has been measured.
METHODS: Phage P22 virions were generated by complementation in Salmonella enterica and purified. They were transferred into 100 mM ammonium acetate and then electrosprayed. The masses of individual virions were determined using charge detection mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The stoichiometry of the protein components of phage P22 is sufficiently well known that the theoretical molar mass can be determined to within a narrow range. The measured average molar mass of phage P22, 52,180 ± 59 kDa, is consistent with the theoretical molar mass and supports the proposed stoichiometry of the components. The intrinsic width of the phage P22 mass distribution can be accounted for by the distribution of DNA packaged by the headful mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS: At over 50 MDa, phage P22 is the largest object with a well-defined molar mass to be analyzed by mass spectrometry. The narrow measured mass distribution indicates that the virions survive the transition into the gas phase intact. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {6-Azauracil (6 AU) inhibits enzymes in nucleoside synthesis and depletes the intracellular GTP/UTP pool. Mutations in transcriptional elongation machinery, as well as mutations in a variety of other pathways, exaggerate the growth defect of cells in the presence of 6 AU. Thus, identification of mutations that render cells sensitive to 6 AU will benefit study on the basis of 6 AU-sensitive phenotype. Here we performed a genome-wide screen of a fission yeast deletion library. Of 3235 single-gene deletions, 66 mutants displayed at least 50{\%} drop of fitness in the presence of 6 AU and 60 mutants were reported for the first time; five deletions showed synthetic decrease of fitness when combined with deletion of set3+, which encodes a transcriptional regulator. Genes conferring tolerance to 6 AU were enriched in various processes, especially in chromosome segregation. Accordingly, genes encoding subunits of CLRC complex and spindle pole body were over-represented. Mutants were subjected to an in vivo transcript length-dependent reporter assay to assess the potential roles of deleted genes in transcriptional elongation. As with the deletions known to affect elongation, nab2$\Delta$, nxt1$\Delta$, rhp18$\Delta$, SPAC24C9.08$\Delta$, clr3$\Delta$ and ncs1$\Delta$set3$\Delta$ mutants exhibited defects in expressing long transcripts. New 6 AU-sensitive mutants identified here will help to elucidate the mechanism of action of 6 AU in the cells. Meanwhile, our study revealed novel genes potentially involved in transcriptional elongation and provided valuable targets for transcription study.

abstract = {Cyclic nucleotide-modulated ion channels are important for signal transduction and pacemaking in eukaryotes. The molecular determinants of ligand gating in these channels are still unknown, mainly because of a lack of direct structural information. Here we report ligand-induced conformational changes in full-length MloK1, a cyclic nucleotide-modulated potassium channel from the bacterium Mesorhizobium loti, analysed by electron crystallography and atomic force microscopy. Upon cAMP binding, the cyclic nucleotide-binding domains move vertically towards the membrane, and directly contact the S1-S4 voltage sensor domains. This is accompanied by a significant shift and tilt of the voltage sensor domain helices. In both states, the inner pore-lining helices are in an 'open' conformation. We propose a mechanism in which ligand binding can favour pore opening via a direct interaction between the cyclic nucleotide-binding domains and voltage sensors. This offers a simple mechanistic hypothesis for the coupling between ligand gating and voltage sensing in eukaryotic HCN channels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Masoro2005,
abstract = {It has been known for some 70 years that restricting the food intake of laboratory rats extends their mean and maximum life span. In addition, such life extension has been observed over the years in many other species, including mice, hamsters, dogs, fish, invertebrate animals, and yeast. Since this life-extending action appears to be due to a restricted intake of energy, this dietary manipulation is referred to as caloric restriction (CR). CR extends life by slowing and/or delaying the ageing processes. The underlying biological mechanism responsible for the life extension is still not known, although many hypotheses have been proposed. The Growth Retardation Hypothesis, the first proposed, has been tested and found wanting. Although there is strong evidence against the Reduction of Body Fat Hypothesis, efforts have recently been made to resurrect it. While the Reduction of Metabolic Rate Hypothesis is not supported by experimental findings, it nevertheless still has advocates. Currently, the most popular concept is the Oxidative Damage Attenuation Hypothesis; the results of several studies provide support for this hypothesis, while those of other studies do not. The Altered Glucose-Insulin System Hypothesis and the Alteration of the Growth Hormone-IGF-1 Axis Hypothesis have been gaining favor, and data have emerged that link these two hypotheses as one. Thus, it may now be more appropriate to refer to them as the Attenuation of Insulin-Like Signaling Hypothesis. Finally, the Hormesis Hypothesis may provide an overarching concept that embraces several of the other hypotheses as merely specific examples of hormetic processes. For example, the Oxidative Damage Attenuation Hypothesis probably addresses only one of likely many damaging processes that underlie aging. It is proposed that low-intensity stressors, such as CR, activate ancient hormetic defense mechanisms in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, defending them against a variety of adversities and, when long-term, retarding senescent processes.},

The function of Gurken signalling in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis later in oogenesis is better understood. Anterior-posterior patterning of the embryo requires activities of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, localised within the oocyte. A microtubule motor, Kinesin, is directly implicated in localisation of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the oocyte.},

abstract = {Sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18 or neuraminidases) remove sialic acid from sialoglycoconjugates, are widely distributed in nature, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. The three-dimensional structure of influenza virus sialidase is known, and we now report the three-dimensional structure of a bacterial sialidase, from Salmonella typhimurium LT2, at 2.0-A resolution and the structure of its complex with the inhibitor 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid at 2.2-A resolution. The viral enzyme is a tetramer; the bacterial enzyme, a monomer. Although the monomers are of similar size (approximately 380 residues), the sequence similarity is low (approximately 15{\%}). The viral enzyme contains at least eight disulfide bridges, conserved in all strains, and binds Ca2+, which enhances activity; the bacterial enzyme contains one disulfide and does not bind Ca2+. Comparison of the two structures shows a remarkable similarity both in the general fold and in the spatial arrangement of the catalytic residues. However, an rms fit of 3.1 A between 264 C alpha atoms of the S. typhimurium enzyme and those from an influenza A virus reflects some major differences in the fold. In common with the viral enzyme, the bacterial enzyme active site consists of an arginine triad, a hydrophobic pocket, and a key tyrosine and glutamic acid, but differences in the interactions with the O4 and glycerol groups of the inhibitor reflect differing kinetics and substrate preferences of the two enzymes. The repeating "Asp-box" motifs observed among the nonviral sialidase sequences occur at topologically equivalent positions on the outside of the structure. Implications of the structure for the catalytic mechanism, evolution, and secretion of the enzyme are discussed.},

abstract = {The diagnostic evaluation of patients with isolated left bundle branch block (LBBB) is challenging due to limitations of several non-invasive tests. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in asymptomatic patients with LBBB. Sixty-one asymptomatic patients with complete LBBB who were referred for CMR from January 2005 to November 2010 were identified. 29 patients (18 men) had normal echocardiograms (echo) whereas 25 (18 men) had abnormal findings on echo. Six had no echo and one had poor echo windows, and these patients were excluded from further analysis. Patients with cardiac symptoms or known coronary artery disease at the time of referral were also excluded. Of the 29 patients with normal echo, 9 (31{\%}) were found to have pathological findings on CMR. The most common abnormalities were dilated cardiomyopathy-DCM (n = 6, 21{\%}) followed by left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 2, 7{\%}). Of the 25 patients who had an abnormal echo, CMR confirmed the diagnosis in 19 (76{\%}) and provided clinically relevant additional information in 13 (52{\%}) subjects. Of these 13 patients, 9 (69{\%}) had characteristic patterns of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (8 mid-wall and 1 patchy distribution consistent with DCM and cardiac sarcoid, respectively). CMR detects sub-clinical cardiomyopathy in a third of asymptomatic patients with LBBB despite normal echocardiograms. In those with abnormal echocardiograms, CMR provides additional clinically relevant information in over 50{\%} of patients, including a high prevalence of mid-wall fibrosis in patients with impaired left ventricular function. These findings support the use of CMR as a valuable adjunct to conventional investigations in asymptomatic LBBB.},

The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing. In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy. We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 {\AA} C $\alpha$-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at {\textless}ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://EVfold.org" xlink:type="simple" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{\textgreater}http://EVfold.org{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Marks et al.},

abstract = {A conserved DNA repair response is defective in the human genetic illness Fanconi anemia (FA). Mutation of some FA genes impairs homologous recombination and error-prone DNA repair, rendering FA cells sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. We found a genetic interaction between the FA gene FANCC and the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factor Ku70. Disruption of both FANCC and Ku70 suppresses sensitivity to cross-linking agents, diminishes chromosome breaks, and reverses defective homologous recombination. Ku70 binds directly to free DNA ends, committing them to NHEJ repair. We show that purified FANCD2, a downstream effector of the FA pathway, might antagonize Ku70 activity by modifying such DNA substrates. These results reveal a function for the FA pathway in processing DNA ends, thereby diverting double-strand break repair away from abortive NHEJ and toward homologous recombination.},

abstract = {Missing values are a genuine issue in label-free quantitative proteomics. Recent works have surveyed the different statistical methods to conduct imputation and have compared them on real or simulated data sets and recommended a list of missing value imputation methods for proteomics application. Although insightful, these comparisons do not account for two important facts: (i) depending on the proteomics data set, the missingness mechanism may be of different natures and (ii) each imputation method is devoted to a specific type of missingness mechanism. As a result, we believe that the question at stake is not to find the most accurate imputation method in general but instead the most appropriate one. We describe a series of comparisons that support our views: For instance, we show that a supposedly " under-performing " method (i.e., giving baseline average results), if applied at the " appropriate " time in the data-processing pipeline (before or after peptide aggregation) on a data set with the " appropriate " nature of missing values, can outperform a blindly applied, supposedly " better-performing " method (i.e., the reference method from the state-of-the-art). This leads us to formulate few practical guidelines regarding the choice and the application of an imputation method in a proteomics context.},

abstract = {Development of efficient and safe cancer therapy is one of the major challenges of the modern medicine. Over the last few years antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become a powerful tool in cancer treatment with two of them, Adcetris?? (brentuximab vedotin) and Kadcyla?? (ado-trastuzumab emtansine), having recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Essentially, an ADC is a bioconjugate that comprises a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds tumor surface antigen and a highly potent drug, which is attached to the antibody via either cleavable or stable linker. This approach ensures specificity and efficacy in fighting cancer cells, while healthy tissues remain largely unaffected.Conventional ADCs, that employ cysteine or lysine residues as conjugation sites, are highly heterogeneous. This means that the species contain various populations of the ADCs with different drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) and different drug load distributions. DAR and drug-load distribution are essential parameters of ADCs as they determine their stability and efficacy. Therefore, various drug-loaded forms of ADCs (usually from zero to eight conjugated molecules per antibody) may have distinct pharmacokinetics (PK) in vivo and may differ in clinical performance. Recently, a significant progress has been made in the field of site-specific conjugation which resulted in a number of strategies for synthesis of the homogeneous ADCs. This review describes newly-developed methods that ensure homogeneity of the ADCs including use of engineered reactive cysteine residues (THIOMAB), unnatural amino acids, aldehyde tags, enzymatic transglutaminase- and glycotransferase-based approaches and novel chemical methods. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the limitation of these methods emphasizing the need for further improvement in the ADC design and development.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that are essential mediators of fast chemical neurotransmission and are associated with a large number of neurological diseases and disorders, as well as parasitic infections. Members of this ion channel superfamily mediate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission depending on their ligand and ion selectivity. Structural information for Cys-loop receptors comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, high-resolution X-ray structures of extracellular domains and X-ray structures of bacterial orthologues. In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis for anion selectivity and channel block, and the mechanism by which ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate neurotransmitter binding. However, there remain unanswered questions about the mechanism of channel opening and closing, the location and nature of the shut ion channel gate, the transitions between the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states, and the mechanism by which conformational changes are coupled between the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane, ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids.},

abstract = {Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P {\textless} 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.},

abstract = {Understanding complex networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is one of the foremost challenges of the post-genomic era. Due to the recent advances in experimental bio-technology, including yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H), tandem affinity purification (TAP) and other high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) detection, huge amounts of PPI network data are becoming available. Of major concern, however, are the levels of noise and incompleteness. For example, for Y2H screens, it is thought that the false positive rate could be as high as 64{\%}, and the false negative rate may range from 43{\%} to 71{\%}. TAP experiments are believed to have comparable levels of noise. We present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks obtained from experimental studies. We use it for predicting new interactions and thus for guiding future biological experiments. This technique is the first to utilize currently the best fitting network model for PPI networks, geometric graphs. Our approach achieves specificity of 85{\%} and sensitivity of 90{\%}. We use it to assign confidence scores to physical protein-protein interactions in the human PPI network downloaded from BioGRID. Using our approach, we predict 251 interactions in the human PPI network, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common GO terms. Moreover, we validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID.

However, for many functions, assay complexity and cost make genome-scale knockdown experiments impossible. Methods to predict genes required for cell functions are therefore needed to focus RNAi screens from the whole genome on the most likely candidates. Although different bioinformatics tools for gene function prediction exist, they lack experimental validation and are therefore rarely used by experimentalists. To address this, we developed an effective computational gene selection strategy that represents public data about genes as graphs and then analyzes these graphs using kernels on graph nodes to predict functional relationships. To demonstrate its performance, we predicted human genes required for a poorly understood cellular function-mitotic chromosome condensation-and experimentally validated the top 100 candidates with a focused RNAi screen by automated microscopy. Quantitative analysis of the images demonstrated that the candidates were indeed strongly enriched in condensation genes, including the discovery of several new factors. By combining bioinformatics prediction with experimental validation, our study shows that kernels on graph nodes are powerful tools to integrate public biological data and predict genes involved in cellular functions of interest.},

abstract = {Several variants of the beta amyloid protein, differing only at their carboxy terminus (beta 1-39, beta 1-40, beta 1-42, and beta 1-43), have been identified as the major components of the cerebral amyloid deposits which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Kinetic studies of aggregation by three naturally occurring beta protein variants (beta 1-39, beta 1-40, beta 1-42) and four model peptides (beta 26-39, beta 26-40, beta 26-42, beta 26-43) demonstrate that amyloid formation, like crystallization, is a nucleation-dependent phenomenon. This discovery has practical consequences for studies of the beta amyloid protein. The length of the C-terminus is a critical determinant of the rate of amyloid formation ("kinetic solubility") but has only a minor effect on the thermodynamic solubility. Amyloid formation by the kinetically soluble peptides (e.g., beta 1-39, beta 1-40, beta 26-39, beta 26-40) can be nucleated, or "seeded", by peptides which include the critical C-terminal residues (beta 1-42, beta 26-42, beta 26-43, beta 34-42). These results suggest that nucleation may be the rate-determining step of in vivo amyloidogenesis and that beta 1-42 and/or beta 1-43, rather than beta 1-40, may be the pathogenic protein(s) in AD.},

Neural networks are not, in general, capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks which they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on the MNIST hand written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

abstract = {Motivation: Function annotation of an unclassified protein on the basis of its interaction partners is well documented in the literature. Reliable predictions of interactions from other data sources such as gene expression measurements would provide a useful route to function annotation. We investigate the global relationship of protein-protein interactions with gene expression. This relationship is studied in four evolutionarily diverse species, for which substantial information regarding their interactions and expression is available: human, mouse, yeast and Escherichia coli. Results: In E. coli the expression of interacting pairs is highly correlated in comparison to random pairs, while in the other three species, the correlation of expression of interacting pairs is only slightly stronger than that of random pairs. To strengthen the correlation, we developed a protocol to integrate ortholog information into the interaction and expression datasets. In all four genomes, the likelihood of predicting protein interactions from highly correlated expression data is increased using our protocol. In yeast, for example, the likelihood of predicting a true interaction, when the correlation is {\textgreater}0.9, increases from 1.4 to 9.4. The improvement demonstrates that protein interactions are reflected in gene expression and the correlation between the two is strengthened by evolution information. The results establish that co-expression of interacting protein pairs is more conserved than that of random ones. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.},

abstract = {Membrane attack complex/perforin-like (MACPF) proteins comprise the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins, playing crucial roles in immunity and pathogenesis. Soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. Here we present an 11 {\AA} resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin Pleurotolysin (Ply), together with crystal structures of both components (the lipid binding PlyA protein and the pore-forming MACPF component PlyB). These data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 {\AA} in diameter and 100 {\AA} in height, with each subunit comprised of a PlyB molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of PlyA. The resolution of the EM map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a MACPF pore assembly. The major conformational changes in PlyB are a ∼70° opening of the bent and distorted central $\beta$-sheet of the MACPF domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two $\alpha$-helical regions into transmembrane $\beta$-hairpins (TMH1 and TMH2). We determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. Analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of $\beta$-sheet unbending. The results suggest that MACPF conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of TMH2. Following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into $\beta$-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted $\beta$-barrel. The intermediate structures of the MACPF domain during refolding into the $\beta$-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily. The TMH2 region is critical for the release of both TMH clusters, suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of MACPF function.},

abstract = {Colicin M (Cma) displays a unique mode of action in that it inhibits peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis through interference with bactoprenyl phosphate recycling. Protection of Cma-producing cells by the immunity protein (Cmi) was studied. The amount of Cmi determined the degree of inhibition of in vitro peptidoglycan synthesis by Cma. In cells, immunity breakdown could be achieved by overexpression of the Cma uptake system. Full immunity was restored after raising the cmi gene copy number. In sphaeroplasts, Cmi was degraded by trypsin, but this could be prevented by the addition of Cma. The N-terminal end includes the only hydrophobic amino acid sequence of Cmi, suggesting a function in anchoring of Cmi in the cytoplasmic membrane. It is proposed that Cmi does not act catalytically but binds Cma at the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane, thereby resulting in Cma inactivation. Two other possible modes of colicin M immunity, interference of Cmi with the uptake of Cma, and interaction of Cmi with the target of Cma, were ruled out by the data.},

Here, we present a strategy for genotype-phenotype reasoning based on existing knowledge of cellular subsystems. These subsystems and their hierarchical organization are defined by the Gene Ontology or a complementary ontology inferred directly from previously published datasets. Guided by the ontology's hierarchical structure, we organize genotype data into an "ontotype," that is, a hierarchy of perturbations representing the effects of genetic variation at multiple cellular scales. The ontotype is then interpreted using logical rules generated by machine learning to predict phenotype. This approach substantially outperforms previous non-hierarchical methods for translating yeast genotype to cell growth phenotype, and it accurately predicts the growth outcomes of two new screens of 2,503 double gene knockouts affecting DNA repair or nuclear lumen. Ontotypes also generalize to larger knockout combinations, setting the stage for interpreting the complex genetics of disease.},

However, this diagnosis was excluded by HIBCH sequencing and normal enzyme activity. In contrast to HIBCH deficiency, the excretion of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-carnitine was normal in the children, suggesting deficiency of short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1 gene). This mitochondrial enzyme is active in several metabolic pathways involving fatty acids and amino acids, including valine, and is immediately upstream of HIBCH in the valine pathway. Both children were compound heterozygous for a c.473C {\textgreater} A (p.A158D) missense mutation and a c.414+3G {\textgreater} C splicing mutation in ECHS1. ECHS1 activity was markedly decreased in cultured fibroblasts from both siblings, ECHS1 protein was undetectable by immunoblot analysis and transfection of patient cells with wild-type ECHS1 rescued ECHS1 activity. The highly reactive metabolites methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA accumulate in deficiencies of both ECHS1 and HIBCH and are probably responsible for the brain pathology in both disorders. Deficiency of ECHS1 or HIBCH should be considered in children with Leigh disease. Urine metabolite testing can detect and distinguish between these two disorders.},

The extent of hydrolysis was detected by measuring the amount of (soluble) degradation products in solution using reversed-phase HPLC. Crystallinity greatly affects the capability of the enzyme to hydrolyze the ester bonds, displaying relatively high activity towards an amorphous polyester film and little activity on a highly crystalline substrate. The enzyme is sufficiently stable, hydrolysis rate on the amorphous substrate maintained at sufficient high level over a long period of time of at least five days. From an industrial point of view it is highly recommended to increase the hydrolysis rates. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

According to the predicted amino acid sequence, the colicin A polypeptide chain comprises 592 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 62,989. The amino-terminal part is rich in proline and glycine and accordingly secondary structure prediction indicates that this region (1 to 185) is beta-structured. The rest of the molecule (residues 186 to 592) is very rich in alpha-helix. An uncharged amino acid sequence of 48 residues is located in the C-terminal part of the molecule, which is involved in the membrane depolarization caused by colicin A. A similar region has been found in colicin E1, which has the same mode of action as colicin A. Three peptides of these bacteriocins were found to be homologous, but a comparison of the bacteriocin genes did not reveal any significant homology out of the corresponding regions.

abstract = {Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a common disorder that predisposes to neoplasia in tissues derived from the embryonic neural crest. The NF1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor that most likely acts through the interaction of its GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) with the product of the ras protooncogene. We have previously identified a site in the NF1 mRNA, within the first half of the NF1 GRD, which undergoes base-modification editing. Editing at that site changes a C to a U, thereby introducing an in-frame stop codon. NF1 RNA editing has been detected in all cell types studied, to date. In order to investigate the role played by editing in NF1 tumorigenesis, we analyzed RNA from 19 NF1 and 4 non-NF1 tumors. We observed varying levels of NF1 mRNA editing in different tumors, with a higher range of editing levels in more malignant tumors (e.g., neurofibrosarcomas) compared to benign tumors (cutaneous neurofibromas). Plexiform neurofibromas have an intermediate range of levels of NF1 mRNA editing. We also compared tumor and nontumor tissues from several NF1 individuals, to determine the extent of variability present in the constitutional levels of NF1 mRNA editing and to determine whether higher levels are present in tumors. The constitutional levels of NF1 mRNA editing varied slightly but were consistent with the levels observed in non-NF1 individuals. In every case, there was a greater level of NF1 mRNA editing in the tumor than in the nontumor tissue from the same patient. These results suggest that inappropriately high levels of NF1 mRNA editing does play a role in NF1 tumorigenesis and that editing may result in the functional equivalent of biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor.},

With the rapid increase in size of the biological databanks, it is essential to use computer programs to automate the classification process. At present, the computer programs that give the best prediction performance are support vector machines (SVMs). This is because SVMs are designed to maximise the margin to separate two classes so that the trained model generalises well on unseen data. Most other computer programs implement a classifier through the minimisation of error occurred in training, which leads to poorer generalisation. Because of this, SVMs have been widely applied to many areas of bioinformatics including protein function prediction, protease functional site recognition, transcription initiation site prediction and gene expression data classification. This paper will discuss the principles of SVMs and the applications of SVMs to the analysis of biological data, mainly protein and DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory signaling in the nervous system. Despite the profound importance of iGluRs to neurotransmission, little is known about the structures and dynamics of intact receptors in distinct functional states. Here, we elucidate the structures of the intact GluA2 AMPA receptor in an apo resting/closed state, in an activated/pre-open state bound with partial agonists and a positive allosteric modulator, and in a desensitized/closed state in complex with fluorowilliardiine. To probe the conformational properties of these states, we carried out double electron-electron resonance experiments on cysteine mutants and cryoelectron microscopy studies. We show how agonist binding modulates the conformation of the ligand-binding domain "layer" of the intact receptors and how, upon desensitization, the receptor undergoes large conformational rearrangements of the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. We define mechanistic principles by which to understand antagonism, activation, and desensitization in AMPA iGluRs. Structures reveal the conformational bases for antagonism, activation, and desensitization for ionotropic glutamate receptors, the principle mediator of fast excitatory signaling in the nervous system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Parallels can be made between the SV40 L-Tag and the human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoproteins (E6 and E7) as they are also able to deregulate the cell cycle in order to promote cell transformation and its maintenance. In this review, a presentation of the SV40 L-Tag characteristics, regarding viral replication and cellular transformation, will show how similar these two processes are between the polyoma- and papillomavirus families.

Tau isolated from a 2.5{\%} perchloric extract of AD brain had almost the same activity as that obtained from control brain, and this activity did not change significantly on dephosphorylation. Abnormally phosphorylated tau (AD P-tau) isolated from brain homogenate of AD patients had little activity, and upon dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase, its activity increased to approximately the same level as the acid-soluble tau. Addition of AD P-tau to a mixture of normal tau and tubulin inhibited microtubule assembly. AD P-tau bound to normal tau but not to tubulin. These studies suggest that the abnormal phosphorylation of tau might be responsible for the breakdown of microtubules in affected neurons in AD not only because the altered protein has little microtubule-promoting activity but also because it interacts with normal tau, making the latter unavailable for promoting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules.},

abstract = {Advances in experimental and computational methods have quietly ushered in a new era in protein function annotation. This 'age of multiplicity' is marked by the notion that only the use of multiple tools, multiple evidence and considering the multiple aspects of function can give us the broad picture that 21st century biology will need to link and alter micro- and macroscopic phenotypes. It might also help us to undo past mistakes by removing errors from our databases and prevent us from producing more. On the downside, multiplicity is often confusing. We therefore systematically review methods and resources for automated protein function prediction, looking at individual (biochemical) and contextual (network) functions, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Propofol is the most important intravenous general anesthetic in current clinical use. It acts by potentiating GABAA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors, but where it binds to this receptor is not known and has been a matter of some debate. We synthesized a new propofol analog photolabeling reagent whose biological activity is very similar to that of propofol. We confirmed that this reagent labeled known propofol binding sites in human serum albumin that have been identified using X-ray crystallography. Using a combination of protiated and deuterated versions of the reagent to label mammalian receptors in intact membranes, we identified a new binding site for propofol in GABAA receptors consisting of both $\beta$3 homopentamers and $\alpha$1$\beta$3 heteropentamers. The binding site is located within the $\beta$ subunit at the interface between the transmembrane domains and the extracellular domain and lies close to known determinants of anesthetic sensitivity in the transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is generally acknowledged that a functional understanding of a biological system can only be obtained by an understanding of the collective of molecular interactions in form of biological networks. Protein networks are one particular network type of special importance, because proteins form the functional base units of every biological cell. On a mesoscopic level of protein networks, modules are of significant importance because these building blocks may be the next elementary functional level above individual proteins allowing to gain insight into fundamental organizational principles of biological cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of five popular and four novel module detection algorithms. We study these module prediction methods for simulated benchmark networks as well as 10 biological protein interaction networks (PINs). A particular focus of our analysis is placed on the biological meaning of the predicted modules by utilizing the Gene Ontology (GO) database as gold standard for the definition of biological processes. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the results by perturbing the PINs simulating in this way our incomplete knowledge of protein networks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study reveals that there is a large heterogeneity among the different module prediction algorithms if one zooms-in the biological level of biological processes in the form of GO terms and all methods are severely affected by a slight perturbation of the networks. However, we also find pathways that are enriched in multiple modules, which could provide important information about the hierarchical organization of the system.},

When yeast prion proteins switch state, they produce heritable phenotypes. We report prion-like properties in a neuronal member of the CPEB family (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein), which regulates mRNA translation. Compared to other CPEB family members, the neuronal protein has an N-terminal extension that shares characteristics of yeast prion-determinants: a high glutamine content and predicted conformational flexibility. When fused to a reporter protein in yeast, this region confers upon it the epigenetic changes in state that characterize yeast prions. Full-length CPEB undergoes similar changes, but surprisingly it is the dominant, self-perpetuating prion-like form that has the greatest capacity to stimulate translation of CPEB-regulated mRNA. We hypothesize that conversion of CPEB to a prion-like state in stimulated synapses helps to maintain long-term synaptic changes associated with memory storage.},

abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human gamma-herpesvirus, can establish both nonproductive (latent) and productive (lytic) infections. Although the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to latently infected cells is well characterized, very little is known about T cell controls over lytic infection; this imbalance in our understanding belies the importance of virus-replicative lesions in several aspects of EBV disease pathogenesis. The present work shows that the primary CD8+ CTL response to EBV in infectious mononucleosis patients contains multiple lytic antigen-specific reactivities at levels at least as high as those seen against latent antigens; similar reactivities are also detectable in CTL memory. Clonal analysis revealed individual responses to the two immediate early proteins BZLF1 and BRLF1, and to three (BMLF1, BMRF1, and BALF2) of the six early proteins tested. In several cases, the peptide epitope and HLA-restricting determinant recognized by these CTLs has been defined, one unusual feature being the number of responses restricted through HLA-C alleles. The work strongly suggests that EBV-replicative lesions are subject to direct CTL control in vivo and that immediate early and early proteins are frequently the immunodominant targets. This contrasts with findings in alpha- and beta-herpesvirus systems (herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus) where viral interference with the antigen-processing pathway during lytic infection renders immediate early and early proteins much less immunogenic. The unique capacity of gamma-herpesvirus to amplify the viral load in vivo through a latent growth-transforming infection may have rendered these agents less dependent upon viral replication as a means of successfully colonizing their hosts.},

abstract = {Intron removal during pre-mRNA splicing in higher eukaryotes requires the accurate identification of the two splice sites at the ends of the exons, or exon definition. The sequences constituting the splice sites provide insufficient information to distinguish true splice sites from the greater number of false splice sites that populate transcripts. Additional information used for exon recognition resides in a large number of positively or negatively acting elements that lie both within exons and in the adjacent introns. The identification of such sequence motifs has progressed rapidly in recent years, such that extensive lists are now available for exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers. These motifs have been identified both by empirical experiments and by computational predictions, the validity of the latter being confirmed by experimental verification. Molecular searches have been carried out either by the selection of sequences that bind to splicing factors, or enhance or silence splicing in vitro or in vivo. Computational methods have focused on sequences of 6 or 8 nucleotides that are over- or under-represented in exons, compared to introns or transcripts that do not undergo splicing. These various methods have sought to provide global definitions of motifs, yet the motifs are distinctive to the method used for identification and display little overlap. Astonishingly, at least three-quarters of a typical mRNA would be comprised of these motifs. A present challenge lies in understanding how the cell integrates this surfeit of information to generate what is usually a binary splicing decision.},

The structurally characterized colicin IDPs we consider contain linear binding epitopes for proteins within their target cells that the colicin hijacks during entry. We show that these binding epitopes take part in intramolecular interactions in the absence of protein partners, i.e. self-recognition, and consider the structural origins of this and its functional implications.

The structures unwound by the helicase were of two types: (i) quadruplexes comprising four parallel strands that were generated by annealing oligonucleotides including clustered G residues in a buffer containing Na+ions. Each parallel quadruplex consisted of four oligonucleotide molecules. (ii) Complexes comprising two parallel and two antiparallel strands that were generated by annealing the above oligonucleotides in a buffer containing K+ions. Each antiparallel complex consisted of two folded oligonucleotide molecules. Unwinding of these unusual DNA structures by the T-ag was monitored by gel electrophoresis. The unwinding process required ATP and at least one single stranded 3'-tail extending beyond the four stranded region. These data indicated that the T-ag first binds the 3'-tail and moves in a 3'--{\textgreater}5'direction, using energy provided by ATP hydrolysis; then it unwinds the four stranded DNA into single strands. This helicase activity may affect processes such as recombination and telomere extension, in which four stranded DNA could play a role.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na(+) channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 {\AA} resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 {\AA} wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.},

Often, for proteins available only in "molecular biological" amounts, it is difficult or impossible to make an accurate experimental measurement of the molar extinction coefficient of the protein. Yet without a reliable value of this parameter, one cannot determine protein concentrations by the usual uv spectroscopic means. Fortunately, knowledge of amino acid residue sequence and promoter molecular weight (and thus also of amino acid composition) is generally available through the DNA sequence, which is usually accurately known for most such proteins. In this paper we present a method for calculating accurate (to +/- 5{\%} in most cases) molar extinction coefficients for proteins at 280 nm, simply from knowledge of the amino acid composition. The method is calibrated against 18 "normal" globular proteins whose molar extinction coefficients are accurately known, and the assumptions underlying the method, as well as its limitations, are discussed.},

abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

abstract = {Background: Different high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing platforms are currently available but a trade-off currently exists between the cost and number of reads that can be generated versus the read length that can be achieved. Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe an experimental and computational pipeline yielding millions of reads that can exceed 200 bp with quality scores approaching that of traditional Sanger sequencing. The method combines an automatable gel-less library construction step with paired-end sequencing on a short-read instrument. With appropriately sized library inserts, mate-pair sequences can overlap, and we describe the SHERA software package that joins them to form a longer composite read. Conclusions/Significance: This strategy is broadly applicable to sequencing applications that benefit from low-cost highthroughput sequencing, but require longer read lengths. We demonstrate that our approach enables metagenomic analyses using the Illumina Genome Analyzer, with low error rates, and at a fraction of the cost of pyrosequencing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Rodrigue et al.},

abstract = {The cytotoxic activity of the secreted bacterial toxin colicin E9 is due to a nonspecific DNase housed in the C-terminus of the protein. A kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of complex formation for both the holotoxin and the isolated DNase domain with the cytoplasmic inhibitor of this enzyme, the immunity protein Im9, is presented. The dissociation constant for each complex was calculated from the ratio of the association and dissociation rate constants. Association was monitored by stopped-flow fluorescence and comprises at least two steps for both complexes, an initial fluorescence enhancement followed by a fluorescence quench. The data are consistent with a two-step binding mechanism in which the rate of formation of an encounter complex (k1) is rate determining and essentially diffusion controlled (4.0 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 for colicin E9) in buffer of low ionic strength. This encounter complex then rearranges to the final stable complex. Sequential stopped-flow experiments using 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan labeled DNase domain support the two-step mechanism and further show that the rate of encounter complex rearrangement is significantly faster than its dissociation. The overall rate of dissociation of the colicin E9-Im9 complex (k(off)) was determined by radioactive subunit exchange to be 3.7 x 10(-7) s-1. Thus, the Kd for the complex (k(off)/k1) is 9.3 x 10(-17) M, which corresponds to a change in free energy on binding of -21.9 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Glucagon secreted by pancreatic $\alpha$-cells is the major hyperglycemic hormone correcting acute hypoglycaemia (glucose counterregulation). In diabetes the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia becomes compromised and chronic hyperglucagonemia appears. There is increasing awareness that glucagon excess may underlie important manifestations of diabetes. However opinions differ widely how glucose controls glucagon secretion. The autonomous nervous system plays an important role in the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia. But it is clear that glucose controls glucagon secretion also by mechanisms involving direct effects on $\alpha$-cells or indirect effects via paracrine factors released from non-$\alpha$-cells within the pancreatic islets. The present review discusses these mechanisms and argues that different regulatory processes are involved in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. Direct glucose effects on the $\alpha$-cell and autocrine mechanisms are probably most significant for the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia. During hyperglycaemia, when secretion from $\beta$- and $\delta$-cells is stimulated, paracrine inhibitory factors generate pulsatile glucagon release in opposite phase to pulsatile release of insulin and somatostatin. High concentrations of glucose have also stimulatory effects on glucagon secretion that tend to balance and even exceed the inhibitory influence. The latter actions might underlie the paradoxical hyperglucagonemia that aggravates hyperglycaemia in persons with diabetes.},

Biochemical and electrophysiological information on the prototypic nAChRs is abundant but structural data at atomic resolution have been missing. Here we present the crystal structure of molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a structural and functional homologue of the amino-terminal ligand-binding domain of an nAChR alpha-subunit. In the AChBP homopentamer, the protomers have an immunoglobulin-like topology. Ligand-binding sites are located at each of five subunit interfaces and contain residues contributed by biochemically determined 'loops' A to F. The subunit interfaces are highly variable within the ion-channel family, whereas the conserved residues stabilize the protomer fold. This AChBP structure is relevant for the development of drugs against, for example, Alzheimer's disease and nicotine addiction.},

abstract = {Voltage sensors regulate the conformations of voltage-dependent ion channels and enzymes. Their nearly switchlike response as a function of membrane voltage comes from the movement of positively charged amino acids, arginine or lysine, across the membrane field. We used mutations with natural and unnatural amino acids, electrophysiological recordings, and x-ray crystallography to identify a charge transfer center in voltage sensors that facilitates this movement. This center consists of a rigid cyclic "cap" and two negatively charged amino acids to interact with a positive charge. Specific mutations induce a preference for lysine relative to arginine. By placing lysine at specific locations, the voltage sensor can be stabilized in different conformations, which enables a dissection of voltage sensor movements and their relation to ion channel opening.},

Using the intrinsic magnetic resonance signals from nuclei, including (31)Phosphorus, (1)Hydrogen, (23)Sodium, and (13)Carbon and, more recently, hyperpolarization techniques, MRS provides a comprehensive metabolic assessment of cardiac muscle. This highly versatile technique has provided insights into the pathophysiology of cardiac metabolism in a wide range of conditions, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, genetic cardiomyopathies, heart transplantation, hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, and diabetes. In addition, MRS has value in the assessment of prognosis and for monitoring therapeutic strategies in heart failure. However, because of the low temporal and spatial resolution of the technique, MRS has so far been limited to research applications. With higher field strength magnets and novel hyperpolarization techniques, the promise of using MRS for clinical applications may eventually be fulfilled.},

abstract = {The rate at which nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are being identified in the human genome is increasing dramatically owing to advances in whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing technologies. Automated methods capable of accurately and reliably distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally neutral nsSNPs are therefore assuming ever-increasing importance. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and server: a species-independent method with optional species-specific weightings for the prediction of the functional effects of protein missense variants. Using a model weighted for human mutations, we obtained performance accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks. Furthermore, in one benchmark, we achieve performance accuracies that outperform current state-of-the-art prediction methods (i.e., SNPs{\&}GO and MutPred). We demonstrate that FATHMM can be efficiently applied to high-throughput/large-scale human and nonhuman genome sequencing projects with the added benefit of phenotypic outcome associations. To illustrate this, we evaluated nsSNPs in wheat (Triticum spp.) to identify some of the important genetic variants responsible for the phenotypic differences introduced by intense selection during domestication. A Web-based implementation of FATHMM, including a high-throughput batch facility and a downloadable standalone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.},

The effect of a point mutation within a coding sequence is traditionally attributed to the deduced change in the corresponding amino acid. However, some point mutations can have much more severe effects on the structure of the encoded protein, for example when they inactivate an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), thereby resulting in exon skipping. ESEs also appear to be especially important in exons that normally undergo alternative splicing. Different classes of ESE consensus motifs have been described, but they are not always easily identified. ESEfinder (http://exon.cshl.edu/ESE/) is a web-based resource that facilitates rapid analysis of exon sequences to identify putative ESEs responsive to the human SR proteins SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55, and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements.},

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

However, since the divergence of the two species approximately 350 million years ago, S. pombe appears to have evolved less rapidly than S. cerevisiae so that it retains more characteristics of the common ancient yeast ancestor, causing it to share more features with metazoan cells. This Primer introduces S. pombe by describing the yeast itself, providing a brief description of the origins of fission yeast research, and illustrating some genetic and bioinformatics tools used to study protein function in fission yeast. In addition, a section on some key differences between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae is included for readers with some familiarity with budding yeast research but who may have an interest in developing research projects using S. pombe.},

Such a modification process, catalyzed by protein prenyltransferase including farnesyltransferase (FT), geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTI), and geranylgeranyltransferase II (GGTII), is required for the transforming activity of many oncogenic proteins, including some RAS family members. In the past three decades, prenyltransferase has been extensively studied as a promising cancer therapeutic target in vitro, in animal models, and in the clinic. Recently, a growing number of studies suggest that prenyltransferases and the substrates FPP and GGPP also play fundamental roles in nervous system development and brain disorders. However, a systemic review about the advances of prenyltransferases in the field of neuroscience is lacking so far. Herein, we give a brief introduction for the structure and distribution of GGTI and comprehensively updated the recent advances of GGTI in neuronal dendritogenesis/synaptogenesis and in learning/memory-related behavioral performance. More importantly, we discussed the involvement of GGTI and its substrate GGPP in neurodegenerative disorders, such as aging, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Niemann-Pick disease type C. The role of FT-FPP and GGTII is mentioned as well to compare with GGTI in these physiological and pathological processes. We hope that this systematical review about what we know about GGTI research in the brain can stimulate further studies on the underlying mechanism of GGTI-mediated isoprenylation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Yet it continues to baffle scientists because of its inherent complexity and the multiple layers of regulation that are required to efficiently generate a diverse repertoire of T and B cells. The non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway is an integral part of the V(D)J reaction, and its numerous players perform critical functions in generating this vast diversity, while ensuring genomic stability. In this review, we summarize the efforts of a number of laboratories including ours in providing the mechanisms of V(D)J regulation with a focus on the NHEJ pathway. This involves discovering new players, unraveling unknown roles for known components, and understanding how deregulation of these pathways contributes to generation of primary immunodeficiencies. A long-standing interest of our laboratory has been to elucidate various mechanisms that control RAG activity. Our recent work has focused on understanding the multiple protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions during V(D)J recombination, which allow efficient and regulated generation of the antigen receptors. Exploring how deregulation of this process contributes to immunodeficiencies also continues to be an important area of research for our group.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used as a model organism in studies of replicative ageing and senescence. The relevance of these studies to ageing in other organisms has, however, been questioned, since this yeast divides by budding rather than fission, the more common pattern in higher organisms. Here we report that, contrary to popular belief, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe also undergoes replicative senescence and in a manner superficially analogous to budding yeast. These experiments provide the first evidence of age asymmetry in cell fission and are consistent with the hypothesis of Jazwinski, that asymmetric division underlies culture immortality. Given their evolutionary divergence, comparison of the ageing determinants in fission and budding yeasts may help identify common mechanisms of the ageing process.

We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher-order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell datasets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference.

abstract = {During their lifetime, people are commonly exposed to several vascular risk factors that may affect brain ageing and cognitive function. In the last few years, increasing evidence suggests that pathological plasma lipid profiles contribute to the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, hypercholesterolemia, especially elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values, that is, increased apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100) levels, represents an independent risk factor. In this study, the effects of ApoB-100 overexpression, either alone or in combination with cerebral expression of human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), on cognitive functions and brain pathology were assessed. Our results show that ApoB-100 overexpression induces memory decline and increases cerebral lipid peroxidation and amyloid beta levels compared to those in wild-type animals. Although double-transgenic ApoBxAPP animals did not develop more distinct behavioral deficits than single-transgenic hAPP littermates, hApoB-100 expression caused additional pathophysiological features, such as high LDL and low HDL-cholesterol levels, increased lipid peroxidation, and pronounced ApoB-100 accumulation in cerebral vessels. Thus, our results indicate that ApoBxAPP mice might better reflect the situation of elderly humans than hAPPsl overexpression alone.},

The extent to which synthetic lethal or other genetic interaction networks are conserved between species remains uncertain. To address this question, we compared literature-curated and experimentally derived genetic interaction networks for two distantly related yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae. We find that 23{\%} of interactions in a novel, high-quality S. pombe literature-curated network are conserved in the existing S. cerevisiae network. Next, we developed a method, called S. pombe SGA analysis (SpSGA), enabling rapid, high-throughput isolation of genetic interactions in this species. Direct comparison by SpSGA and ScSGA of approximately 220 genes involved in DNA replication, the DNA damage response, chromatin remodeling, intracellular transport, and other processes revealed that approximately 29{\%} of genetic interactions are common to both species, with the remainder exhibiting unique, species-specific patterns of genetic connectivity. We define a conserved yeast network (CYN) composed of 106 genes and 144 interactions and suggest that this network may help understand the shared biology of diverse eukaryotic species.},

abstract = {The increasing number and diversity of protein sequence families requires new methods to define and predict details regarding function. Here, we present a method for analysis and prediction of functional sub-types from multiple protein sequence alignments. Given an alignment and set of proteins grouped into sub-types according to some definition of function, such as enzymatic specificity, the method identifies positions that are indicative of functional differences by comparison of sub-type specific sequence profiles, and analysis of positional entropy in the alignment. Alignment positions with significantly high positional relative entropy correlate with those known to be involved in defining sub-types for nucleotidyl cyclases, protein kinases, lactate/malate dehydrogenases and trypsin-like serine proteases. We highlight new positions for these proteins that suggest additional experiments to elucidate the basis of specificity. The method is also able to predict sub-type for unclassified sequences. We assess several variations on a prediction method, and compare them to simple sequence comparisons. For assessment, we remove close homologues to the sequence for which a prediction is to be made (by a sequence identity above a threshold). This simulates situations where a protein is known to belong to a protein family, but is not a close relative of another protein of known sub-type. Considering the four families above, and a sequence identity threshold of 30{\%}, our best method gives an accuracy of 96{\%} compared to 80{\%} obtained for sequence similarity and 74{\%} for BLAST. We describe the derivation of a set of sub-type groupings derived from an automated parsing of alignments from PFAM and the SWISSPROT database, and use this to perform a large-scale assessment. The best method gives an average accuracy of 94{\%} compared to 68{\%} for sequence similarity and 79{\%} for BLAST. We discuss implications for experimental design, genome annotation and the prediction of protein function and protein intra-residue distances. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and function by opening a transmembrane ion channel upon binding of glutamate. Despite their crucial role in neurobiology, the architecture and atomic structure of an intact ionotropic glutamate receptor are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor at 3.6 A resolution in complex with a competitive antagonist. The receptor harbours an overall axis of two-fold symmetry with the extracellular domains organized as pairs of local dimers and with the ion channel domain exhibiting four-fold symmetry. A symmetry mismatch between the extracellular and ion channel domains is mediated by two pairs of conformationally distinct subunits, A/C and B/D. Therefore, the stereochemical manner in which the A/C subunits are coupled to the ion channel gate is different from the B/D subunits. Guided by the GluA2 structure and site-directed cysteine mutagenesis, we suggest that GluN1 and GluN2A NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors have a similar architecture, with subunits arranged in a 1-2-1-2 pattern. We exploit the GluA2 structure to develop mechanisms of ion channel activation, desensitization and inhibition by non-competitive antagonists and pore blockers.},

abstract = {NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self-loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility makes NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for easy exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},

abstract = {One of the most important early developments in the field of proteomics was the advent of automated data acquisition routines that allowed high-throughput unattended data acquisition during HPLC introduction of peptide mixtures to a tandem mass spectrometer. Prior to this, data acquisition was orders of magnitude less efficient being based entirely on lists of predetermined ions generated in a prior HPLC-MS experiment. This process, known generically as data-dependent analysis, empowered the development of shotgun proteomics where hundreds to thousands of peptide sequences are matched per experiment. In their most popular implementation, the most abundant ionized species from every precursor ion scan at each moment in chromatographic time are successively selected for isolation, activation and tandem mass analysis. While extremely powerful, this strategy has one primary limitation in that detectable dynamic range is restricted (in a top-down manner) to the peptides that ionize the best. To circumvent the serial nature of the data-dependent process and increase detectable dynamic range, the concepts of multiplexed and data-independent acquisition (DIA) have emerged. Multiplexed-data acquisition is based on more efficient co-selection and co-dissociation of multiple precursor ions in parallel, the data from which is subsequently de-convoluted to provide polypeptide sequences for each individual precursor ion. DIA has similar goals, but there is no real-time ion selection based on prior precursor ion scans. Instead, predefined m/z ranges are interrogated either by fragmenting all ions entering the mass spectrometer at every single point in chromatographic time; or by dividing the m/z range into smaller m/z ranges for isolation and fragmentation. These approaches aim to fully utilize the capabilities of mass spectrometers to maximize tandem MS acquisition time and to address the need to expand the detectable dynamic range, lower the limit of detection, and improve the overall confidence of peptide identifications and relative protein quantification measurements. This review covers all aspects of multiplexed- and data-independent tandem mass spectrometry in proteomics, from experimental implementations to advances in software for data interpretation.},

When hybrids of hexon mRNA and single-stranded restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of viral DNA were visualized in the electron microscope,branched forms were observed in which 160 nucleotides of RNA from the 5' terminus were not hydrogen bonded to the single-stranded DNA. DNA sequences complementary to the RNA sequences in each 5' tail were found by electron microscopy to be located at 17, 20, and 27 units on the same strand as that coding for the body of the hexon mRNA.

Models of these complexes were submitted by predictor groups and assessed by comparing their geometry to the X-ray structure and by evaluating the quality of the prediction of the regions of interaction and of the pair wise residue contacts. Prediction was successful on 12 of the 17 targets, most of the failures being due to large conformation changes that the algorithms could not cope with. Progress in the prediction quality observed in four years indicates that the experiment is a powerful incentive to develop new procedures that allow for flexibility during docking and incorporate nonstructural information. We therefore call upon structural biologists who study protein-protein complexes to provide targets for further rounds of CAPRI predictions.},

abstract = {Most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are sporadic, but a small percentage of AD cases, called familial AD (FAD), are associated with mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or the amyloid precursor protein. Amyloid precursor protein mutations falling within the amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) sequence lead to a wide range of disease phenotypes. There is increasing evidence that distinct amyloid structures distinguished by amyloid conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies have similarly distinct roles in pathology. It is possible that this phenotypic diversity of FAD associated with mutations within the A$\beta$ sequence is due to differences in the conformations adopted by mutant A$\beta$ peptides, but the effects of FAD mutations on aggregation kinetics and conformational and morphological changes of the A$\beta$ peptide are poorly defined. To gain more insight into this possibility, we therefore investigated the effects of 11 FAD mutations on the aggregation kinetics of A$\beta$, as well as its ability to form distinct conformations recognized by a panel of amyloid conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. We found that most FAD mutations increased the rate of aggregation of A$\beta$. The FAD mutations also led to the adoption of alternative amyloid conformations distinguished by monoclonal antibodies and resulted in the formation of distinct aggregate morphologies as determined by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, several of the mutant peptides displayed a large reduction in thioflavin T fluorescence, despite forming abundant fibrils indicating that thioflavin T is a probe of conformational polymorphisms rather than a reliable indicator of fibrillization. Taken together, these results indicate that FAD mutations falling within the A$\beta$ sequence lead to dramatic changes in aggregation kinetics and influence the ability of A$\beta$ to form immunologically and morphologically distinct amyloid structures.},

abstract = {G protein-gated K + channels (Kir3.1-Kir3.4) control electrical excitability in many different cells. Among their functions relevant to human physiology and disease, they regulate the heart rate and govern a wide range of neuronal activities. Here, we present the first crystal structures of a G protein-gated K + channel. By comparing the wild-type structure to that of a constitutively active mutant, we identify a global conformational change through which G proteins could open a G loop gate in the cytoplasmic domain. The structures of both channels in the absence and presence of PIP 2 suggest that G proteins open only the G loop gate in the absence of PIP 2, but in the presence of PIP 2 the G loop gate and a second inner helix gate become coupled, so that both gates open. We also identify a strategically located Na + ion-binding site, which would allow intracellular Na + to modulate GIRK channel activity. These data provide a structural basis for understanding multiligand regulation of GIRK channel gating. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction and evolution. Results: We have generalized the alignment of protein sequences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF{\_}SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all comparison of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20{\%}. Sensitivity: When the predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF{\_}SIM for a rate of false positives of 10{\%}. Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an increased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7 and 3.3 times more good alignments ('balanced' score {\textgreater} 0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9 and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, superfamily and fold level, respectively. Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33 s on an AMD64 2GHz PC. This is 10 times faster than PROF{\_}SIM and 17 times faster than COMPASS. {\textcopyright} The Author 2004. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The primary transcripts, pre-mRNAs, of almost all protein-coding genes in higher eukaryotes contain multiple non-coding intervening sequences, introns, which must be precisely removed to yield translatable mRNAs. The process of intron excision, splicing, takes place in a massive ribonucleoprotein complex known as the spliceosome. Extensive studies, both genetic and biochemical, in a variety of systems have revealed that essential components of the spliceosome include five small RNAs-U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, each of which functions as a RNA, protein complex called an snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein). In addition to snRNPs, splicing requires many non-snRNP protein factors, the exact nature and number of which has been unclear. Technical advances, including new affinity purification methods and improved mass spectrometry techniques, coupled with the completion of many genome sequences, have now permitted a number of proteomic analyses of purified spliceosomes. These studies, recently reviewed by Jurica and Moore,1 reveal that the spliceosome is composed of as many as 300 distinct proteins and five RNAs, making it among the most complex macromolecular machines known.},

abstract = {The essential autophagy protein and haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor, Beclin 1, interacts with several cofactors (Ambra1, Bif-1, UVRAG) to activate the lipid kinase Vps34, thereby inducing autophagy. In normal conditions, Beclin 1 is bound to and inhibited by Bcl-2 or the Bcl-2 homolog Bcl-X(L). This interaction involves a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain in Beclin 1 and the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L). Other proteins containing BH3 domains, called BH3-only proteins, can competitively disrupt the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L) to induce autophagy. Nutrient starvation, which is a potent physiologic inducer of autophagy, can stimulate the dissociation of Beclin 1 from its inhibitors, either by activating BH3-only proteins (such as Bad) or by posttranslational modifications of Bcl-2 (such as phosphorylation) that may reduce its affinity for Beclin 1 and BH3-only proteins. Thus, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins may participate in the inhibition and induction of autophagy, respectively. This hitherto neglected crosstalk between the core machineries regulating autophagy and apoptosis may redefine the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in oncogenesis and tumor progression.},

abstract = {The enzyme F1-ATPase has been shown to be a rotary motor in which the central gamma-subunit rotates inside the cylinder made of alpha3beta3 subunits. At low ATP concentrations, the motor rotates in discrete 120 degrees steps, consistent with sequential ATP hydrolysis on the three beta-subunits. The mechanism of stepping is unknown. Here we show by high-speed imaging that the 120 degrees step consists of roughly 90 degrees and 30 degrees substeps, each taking only a fraction of a millisecond. ATP binding drives the 90 degrees substep, and the 30 degrees substep is probably driven by release of a hydrolysis product. The two substeps are separated by two reactions of about 1 ms, which together occupy most of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. This scheme probably applies to rotation at full speed ( approximately 130 revolutions per second at saturating ATP) down to occasional stepping at nanomolar ATP concentrations, and supports the binding-change model for ATP synthesis by reverse rotation of F1-ATPase.},

abstract = {Integrins are the major adhesion receptors of leukocytes and platelets. Beta1 and beta2 integrin function on leukocytes is crucial for a successful immune response and the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 initiates the process of blood clotting through binding fibrinogen. Integrins on circulating cells bind poorly to their ligands but become active after 'inside-out' signaling through other membrane receptors. Subjects with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-I) do not express beta2 integrins because of mutations in the gene specifying the beta2 subunit, and they suffer recurrent bacterial infections. Mutations affecting alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin cause the bleeding disorder termed Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Subjects with LAD-III show symptoms of both LAD-I and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Their hematopoietically-derived cells express beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrins, but defective inside-out signaling causes immune deficiency and bleeding problems. The LAD-III lesion has been attributed to a C --{\textgreater} A mutation in the gene encoding calcium and diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor (CALDAGGEF1; official symbol RASGRP2) specifying the CALDAG-GEF1 protein, but we show that this change is not responsible for the LAD-III disorder. Instead, we identify mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3) gene specifying the KINDLIN-3 protein as the cause of LAD-III in Maltese and Turkish subjects. Two independent mutations result in decreased KINDLIN3 messenger RNA levels and loss of protein expression. Notably, transfection of the subjects' lymphocytes with KINDLIN3 complementary DNA but not CALDAGGEF1 cDNA reverses the LAD-III defect, restoring integrin-mediated adhesion and migration.},

PCC6803 (Ssp DnaE intein) has been shown to mediate efficient in vivo and in vitro trans-splicing in a foreign protein context. A cis-splicing Ssp DnaE intein construct displayed splicing activity similar to the trans-splicing form, which suggests that the N- and C-terminal intein fragments have a high affinity interaction. An in vitro trans-splicing system was developed that used a bacterially expressed N-terminal fragment of the Ssp DnaE intein and either a bacterially expressed or chemically synthesized intein C-terminal fragment. Unlike artificially split inteins, the Ssp DnaE intein fragments could be reconstituted in vitro under native conditions to mediate splicing as well as peptide bond cleavage. This property allowed the development of an on-column trans-splicing system that permitted the facile separation of reactants and products. Furthermore, the trans-splicing activity of the Ssp DnaE intein was successfully applied to the cyclization of proteins in vivo. Also, the isolation of the unspliced precursor on chitin resin allowed the cyclization reaction to proceed in vitro. The Ssp DnaE intein thus represents a potentially important protein for in vivo and in vitro protein manipulation.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels mediate fast chemical transmission of nerve signals. The structure of a bacterial proton-gated homolog has been established in its open and locally closed conformations at acidic pH. Here we report its crystal structure at neutral pH, thereby providing the X-ray structures of the two end-points of the gating mechanism in the same pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. The large structural variability in the neutral pH structure observed in the four copies of the pentamer present in the asymmetric unit has been used to analyze the intrinsic fluctuations in this state, which are found to prefigure the transition to the open state. In the extracellular domain (ECD), a marked quaternary change is observed, involving both a twist and a blooming motion, and the pore in the transmembrane domain (TMD) is closed by an upper bend of helix M2 (as in locally closed form) and a kink of helix M1, both helices no longer interacting across adjacent subunits. On the tertiary level, detachment of inner and outer $\beta$ sheets in the ECD reshapes two essential cavities at the ECD-ECD and ECD-TMD interfaces. The first one is the ligand-binding cavity; the other is close to a known divalent cation binding site in other pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. In addition, a different crystal form reveals that the locally closed and open conformations coexist as discrete ones at acidic pH. These structural results, together with site-directed mutagenesis, physiological recordings, and coarse-grained modeling, have been integrated to propose a model of the gating transition pathway.},

abstract = {Of the steps involved in the killing of Escherichia coli by colicins, binding to a specific outer-membrane receptor was the best understood and earliest characterized. Receptor binding was believed to be an indispensable step in colicin intoxication, coming before the less well-understood step of translocation across the outer membrane to present the killing domain to its target. In the process of identifying the translocator for colicin Ia, I created chimaeric colicins, as well as a deletion missing the entire receptor-binding domain of colicin Ia. The normal pathway for colicin Ia killing was shown to require two copies of Cir: one that serves as the primary receptor and a second copy that serves as translocator. The novel Ia colicins retain the ability to kill E. coli, even in the absence of receptor binding, as long as they can translocate via their Cir translocator. Experiments to determine whether colicin M uses a second copy of its receptor, FhuA, as its translocator were hampered by precipitation of colicin M chimaeras in inclusion bodies. Nevertheless, I show that receptor binding can be bypassed for killing, as long as a translocation pathway is maintained for colicin M. These experiments suggest that colicin M, unlike colicin Ia, may normally use a single copy of FhuA as both its receptor and its translocator. Colicin E1 can kill in the absence of receptor binding, using translocation through TolC.},

The reasons for the defect in either tissue are unknown, but its presence in a non-degenerating tissue suggests it is not simply a consequence of neurodegeneration. We now offer confirmation of the AD platelet COX defect. Compared to age-matched controls, in mitochondria isolated from AD platelets there was a 15{\%} decrease in COX activity despite the fact that COX subunits were present at normal levels. Platelet ATP levels were diminished in AD (from 11.33±0.52 to 9.11±0.72nmol/mg), while reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased (from 97.03±25.9 to 338.3±100K/mg). Platelet membrane fluidity, Vitamin E, and cholesterol content were similar between groups. We conclude that COX catalytic activity is indeed diminished in AD platelet mitochondria, does not result from altered membrane fluidity, and is associated with ROS overproduction and ATP underproduction. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

These genomes display massive retrotransposon proliferation, genome-size expansion, and gene losses. The missing genes encode enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and transporters, probably reflecting their redundancy in an exclusively biotrophic life-style. Among the 248 candidate effectors of pathogenesis identified in the Blumeria genome, very few (less than 10) define a core set conserved in all three mildews, suggesting that most effectors represent species-specific adaptations.},

abstract = {A heat stable protein essentail for microtubule assembly has been isolated. This protein, which we designate tau (tau), is present in association with tubulin purified from porcine brain by repeated cycles of polymerization. Tau is separated from tubulin by ion exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose. In the absence of tau, tubulin exists entirely as a 6S dimer of two polypeptide chains (alpha and beta tubulin) with a molecular weight of 120,000, which will not assemble into microtubules in vitro. Addition of tau completely restores tubule-forming capacity. Under nonpolymerizing conditions, tau converts 6S dimers to 36S rings-structures which have been implicated as intermediates in tubule formation. Hence, tau appears to act on the 6S tubulin dimer, activating it for polymerization. The unique ability of tau to restore the normal features of in vitro microtubule assembly makes it likely that tau is a major regulator of microtubule formation in cells.},

@article{Farrance2013,
abstract = {Colicins are protein antibiotics synthesised by Escherichia coli strains to target and kill related bacteria. To prevent host suicide, colicins are inactivated by binding to immunity proteins. Despite their high avidity (K(d) ≈ fM, lifetime ≈ 4 days), immunity protein release is a pre-requisite of colicin intoxication, which occurs on a timescale of minutes. Here, by measuring the dynamic force spectrum of the dissociation of the DNase domain of colicin E9 (E9) and immunity protein 9 (Im9) complex using an atomic force microscope we show that application of low forces ({\textless}20 pN) increases the rate of complex dissociation 10(6)-fold, to a timescale (lifetime ≈ 10 ms) compatible with intoxication. We term this catastrophic force-triggered increase in off-rate a trip bond. Using mutational analysis, we elucidate the mechanism of this switch in affinity. We show that the N-terminal region of E9, which has sparse contacts with the hydrophobic core, is linked to an allosteric activator region in E9 (residues 21-30) whose remodelling triggers immunity protein release. Diversion of the force transduction pathway by the introduction of appropriately positioned disulfide bridges yields a force resistant complex with a lifetime identical to that measured by ensemble techniques. A trip switch within E9 is ideal for its function as it allows bipartite complex affinity, whereby the stable colicin:immunity protein complex required for host protection can be readily converted to a kinetically unstable complex whose dissociation is necessary for cellular invasion and competitor death. More generally, the observation of two force phenotypes for the E9:Im9 complex demonstrates that force can re-sculpt the underlying energy landscape, providing new opportunities to modulate biological reactions in vivo; this rationalises the commonly observed discrepancy between off-rates measured by dynamic force spectroscopy and ensemble methods.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of disability in individuals aged {\textgreater}65 years worldwide. AD is characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide, and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated $\tau$ protein and dementia. The neurotoxic oligomer A$\beta$ peptide, which is the neuropathological diagnostic criterion of the disease, together with $\tau$ protein, are mediators of the neurodegeneration that is among the main causative factors. However, these phenomena are mainly initiated and enhanced by oxidative stress, a process referring to an imbalance between antioxidants and oxidants in favour of oxidants. This imbalance can occur as a result of increased free radicals or a decrease in antioxidant defense, free radicals being a species that contains one or more unpaired electrons in its outer shell. The major source of potent free radicals is the reduction of molecular oxygen in water, that initially yields the superoxide radical, which produces hydrogen peroxide by the addition of an electron. The reduction of hydrogen peroxide produces highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, termed reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can react with lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules and may also alter their structures and functions. Thus, tissues and organs, particularly the brain, a vulnerable organ, are affected by ROS due to its composition. The brain is largely composed of easily oxidizable lipids while featuring a high oxygen consumption rate. The current review examined the role of oxidative stress in AD.},

Small proteins contain one domain; medium and large proteins contain two or more domains. We have compared homologous domains that occur in both one-domain proteins and multidomain proteins. We have determined (1) how the functions of the individual domains in the multidomain proteins combine to produce their overall functions and (2) the extent to which these functions are similar to those in the one-domain homologs. We describe how domain combinations increase the specificity of enzymes; act as links between domains that have functional roles; regulate activity; combine within one chain functions that can act either independently, in concert or in new contexts; and provide the structural framework for the evolution of entirely new functions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we show that there is room to rethink this common view. We propose a critical appraisal of the arguments commonly brought in support of it, and we qualitatively analyse published results that are of relevance to understand whether or not cellular senescence-associated genes really act in an antagonistic-pleiotropic manner in humans. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Members of the RecA family of recombinases from bacteriophage T4, Escherichia coli, yeast, and higher eukaryotes function in recombination as higher-order oligomers assembled on tracts of single-strand DNA (ssDNA). Biochemical studies have shown that assembly of recombinase involves accessory factors. These studies have identified a class of proteins, called recombination mediator proteins, that act by promoting assembly of recombinase on ssDNA tracts that are bound by ssDNA-binding protein (ssb). In the absence of mediators, ssb inhibits recombination reactions by competing with recombinase for DNA-binding sites. Here we briefly review mediated recombinase assembly and present results of new in vivo experiments. Immuno-double-staining experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that Rad51, the eukaryotic recombinase, can assemble at or near sites containing ssb (replication protein A, RPA) during the response to DNA damage, consistent with a need for mediator activity. Correspondingly, mediator gene mutants display defects in Rad51 assembly after DNA damage and during meiosis, although the requirements for assembly are distinct in the two cases. In meiosis, both Rad52 and Rad55/57 are required, whereas either Rad52 or Rad55/57 is sufficient to promote assembly of Rad51 in irradiated mitotic cells. Rad52 promotes normal amounts of Rad51 assembly in the absence of Rad55 at 30 degrees C but not 20 degrees C, accounting for the cold sensitivity of rad55 null mutants. Finally, we show that assembly of Rad51 is induced by radiation during S phase but not during G(1), consistent with the role of Rad51 in repairing the spontaneous damage that occurs during DNA replication.},

abstract = {Mammalian tissue development and regeneration take place within a milieu of regulatory growth factors. These affect many parameters of cell development, such that survival, proliferation, differentiation, and certain aspects of cell behavior are all influenced by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. The precise effect of any given factor is determined by the responding cell type, the concentration of factor, and the presence of other stimuli, such that some growth factors may fulfill a variety of functions under different circumstances. Classically, growth factor stimuli are transmitted into the cell via activation of specific, transmembrane receptors that modify key regulatory proteins in the cytoplasm. These in turn affect the decisions controlling proliferation and differentiation, including changes in gene expression and reactivity to other factors. There are indications that some factors may function both extra- and intracellularly and that this characteristic is correlated with potential oncogenicity. The relatively low transforming ability of extracellular factors alone is probably attributable to the limitations imposed by down-regulation of their cell surface receptors. Aberrant production of secreted growth factors can, however, play decisive roles in tumorigenesis by increasing the proliferation rate and degree of cellular autonomy and extending the area available for tumor expansion.},

abstract = {Hypoxia causes the accumulation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), culminating in the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes such as those for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and NDRG-1/Cap43. Previously, we have demonstrated that intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) is required for the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes. Here we found that, unlike with hypoxia or hypoxia-mimicking conditions, the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) neither induced the HIF-1alpha protein nor stimulated HIF-1-dependent transcription. Furthermore, the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) induced NDRG-1/Cap43 mRNA in HIF-1alpha-deficient cells. It also increased levels of c-Jun protein, causing its phosphorylation. The protein kinase inhibitor K252a abolished c-Jun induction and activator protein 1 (AP-1)-dependent reporter expression caused by Ca(2+) ionophore or hypoxia. K252a also significantly decreased hypoxia-induced VEGF and NDRG-1/Cap43 gene expression in both human and mouse cells. Using a set of deletion VEGF-Luc promoter constructs, we found that both HIF-1 and two AP-1 sites contribute to hypoxia-mediated induction of transcription. In contrast, only AP-1 sites contributed to Ca(2+)-mediated VEGF-Luc induction. A dominant-negative AP-1 prevented Ca(2+)-dependent transcription and partially impaired hypoxia-mediated transcription. In addition, dominant-negative AP-1 diminished the expression of the NDRG-1/Cap43 gene following hypoxia. We conclude that during hypoxia, an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) activates a HIF-1-independent signaling pathway that involves AP-1-dependent transcription. Cooperation between the HIF-1 and AP-1 pathways allows fine regulation of gene expression during hypoxia.},

Predicting the function of such proteins relies mostly on annotated homologs. However, this has resulted in some erroneous annotations, and many proteins have no annotated homologs. Here we propose a de-novo function prediction approach based on identifying biophysical features that underlie function. Using our approach, we discover DNA and RNA binding proteins that cannot be identified based on homology and validate these predictions experimentally. For example, FGF14, which belongs to a family of secreted growth factors was predicted to bind DNA. We verify this experimentally and also show that FGF14 is localized to the nucleus. Mutating the predicted binding site on FGF14 abrogated DNA binding. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated de-novo function prediction based on identifying function-related biophysical features.},

abstract = {From an abstract, informational perspective, protein domains appear analogous to words in natural languages in which the rules of word association are dictated by linguistic rules, or grammar. Such rules exist for protein domains as well, because only a small fraction of all possible domain combinations is viable in evolution. We employ a popular linguistic technique, n-gram analysis, to probe the "proteome grammar"-that is, the rules of association of domains that generate various domain architectures of proteins. Comparison of the complexity measures of "protein languages" in major branches of life shows that the relative entropy difference (information gain) between the observed domain architectures and random domain combinations is highly conserved in evolution and is close to being a universal constant, at ∼1.2 bits. Substantial deviations from this constant are observed in only two major groups of organisms: a subset of Archaea that appears to be cells simplified to the limit, and animals that display extreme complexity. We also identify the n-grams that represent signatures of the major branches of cellular life. The results of this analysis bolster the analogy between genomes and natural language and show that a "quasi-universal grammar" underlies the evolution of domain architectures in all divisions of cellular life. The nearly universal value of information gain by the domain architectures could reflect the minimum complexity of signal processing that is required to maintain a functioning cell.},

abstract = {Background: An excess of caffeine is cytotoxic to all eukaryotic cell types. We aim to study how cells become tolerant to a toxic dose of this drug, and the relationship between caffeine and oxidative stress pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings: We searched for Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants with inhibited growth on caffeine-containing plates. We screened a collection of 2,700 haploid mutant cells, of which 98 were sensitive to caffeine. The genes mutated in these sensitive clones were involved in a number of cellular roles including the H2O2-induced Pap1 and Sty1 stress pathways, the integrity and calcineurin pathways, cell morphology and chromatin remodeling. We have investigated the role of the oxidative stress pathways in sensing and promoting survival to caffeine. The Pap1 and the Sty1 pathways are both required for normal tolerance to caffeine, but only the Sty1 pathway is activated by the drug. Cells lacking Pap1 are sensitive to caffeine due to the decreased expression of the efflux pump Hba2. Indeed, ?hba2 cells are sensitive to caffeine, and constitutive activation of the Pap1 pathway enhances resistance to caffeine in an Hba2-dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance: With our caffeine-sensitive, genome-wide screen of an S. pombe deletion collection, we have demonstrated the importance of some oxidative stress pathway components on wild-type tolerance to the drug. {\textcopyright} 2009 Calvo et al.},

TRAAK channels are twofold symmetric, which precludes a direct extension of gating mechanisms that close canonical fourfold symmetric K(+) channels. We present the crystal structure of human TRAAK in complex with antibody antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) at 2.75-{\AA} resolution. In contrast to a previous structure, this structure reveals a domain-swapped chain connectivity enabled by the helical cap that exchanges two opposing outer helices 180° around the channel. An unrelated conformational change of an inner helix seals a side opening to the membrane bilayer and is associated with structural changes around the K(+)-selectivity filter that may have implications for mechanosensitivity and gating of TRAAK channels.},

To give its many branches a structure and its research a direction, it requires a theoretical framework. We demonstrate the applications of this framework with examples from sport and medicine. Because performance science deals mainly with situations of uncertainty rather than known risks, the needed framework can be provided by the fast-and-frugal heuristics approach. According to this approach, experts learn to rely on heuristics in an adaptive way in order to make accurate decisions. We investigate the adaptive use of heuristics in three ways: the descriptive study of the heuristics in the cognitive "adaptive toolbox;" the prescriptive study of their "ecological rationality," that is, the characterization of the situations in which a given heuristic works; and the engineering study of "intuitive design," that is, the design of transparent aids for making better decisions.},

The amounts of degradation of F-actin depended on the ADP concentration; saturation occurred at about 0.5 mM. Elimination of divalent cations from the medium completely suppressed the effect of ADP on the digestion of F-actin. Other nucleotides were also examined. The effect decreased in the order ADP{\textgreater}ATP≥IDP{\textgreater}GDP=UDP. Adenine, adenosine, AMP, and PP1 had no effect at all. $\epsilon$-ADP had the effect, and its fluorescence was changed on the addition of F-actin. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of F-actin was ADP-dependent.

Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA integrity is pivotal during neuronal development, maintenance and function. DNA damage and alterations in cellular DNA repair capacity have been implicated in the aging process and in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. These findings are supported by research using animal models of AD and in DNA repair deficient animal models. In recent years, novel mechanisms linking DNA damage to neuronal dysfunction have been identified and have led to the development of noninvasive treatment strategies. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms connecting DNA damage to AD pathology may help to develop novel treatment strategies for this debilitating disease. Here we provide an overview of the role of genome instability and DNA repair deficiency in AD pathology and discuss research strategies that include genome instability as a component.},

They control embryonic gene expression by several means, ranging from microRNA-induced degradation of mRNAs to long ncRNA-mediated modification of chromatin. Many aspects of embryogenesis seem to be controlled by ncRNAs, including the maternal-zygotic transition, the maintenance of pluripotency, the patterning of the body axes, the specification and differentiation of cell types and the morphogenesis of organs. Drawing from several animal model systems, we describe two emerging themes for ncRNA function: promoting developmental transitions and maintaining developmental states. These examples also highlight the roles of ncRNAs in ensuring a robust commitment to one of two possible cell fates.},

The map has been derived from a Fourier synthesis of 24,500 terms and represents two crystallographically independent molecules, each of molecular weight 25,000, which are nearly identical in their tertiary structure. The enzyme is composed almost entirely of extended polypeptide chains. A chemical marker unambiguously defines the position of the active centre.

abstract = {Pore-forming colicins are plasmid-encoded bacteriocins that kill Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria. They bind to receptors in the outer membrane and are translocated across the cell envelope to the inner membrane where they form voltage-dependent ion-channels. Colicins are composed of three domains, with the C-terminal domain responsible for pore-formation. Isolated C-terminal pore-forming domains produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli are inactive due to the polarity of the transmembrane electrochemical potential, which is the opposite of that required. However, the pore-forming domain of colicin A (pfColA) fused to a prokaryotic signal peptide (sp-pfColA) is transported across and inserts into the inner membrane of E. coli from the periplasmic side, forming a functional channel. Sp-pfColA is specifically inhibited by the colicin A immunity protein (Cai). This construct has been used to investigate colicin A channel formation in vivo and to characterise the interaction of pfColA with Cai within the inner membrane. These points will be developed further in this review.},

The gene egl-1 encodes a BH3-containing cell death activator that is required for programmed cell death in C. elegans. Gain-of-function (gf) mutations in egl-1 cause the inappropriate programmed cell death of the HSNs in hermaphrodites. These mutations lie 5.6 kb downstream of the egl-1 transcription unit and disrupt the binding of the TRA-1A zinc finger protein, the terminal global regulator of somatic sexual fate. This disruption results in the activation of the egl-1 gene in the HSNs not only in males but also in hermaphrodites. Our findings suggest that in hermaphrodites TRA-1A represses egl-1 transcription in the HSNs to prevent these neurons from undergoing programmed cell death.},

abstract = {Persistent viral infections causing serious diseases derive, primarily, from altered function of the immune system. Knowledge of the very complex composition and function of the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system is essential to understanding persistent infection. The best solution to the problem of persistent infection is by prevention using prophylactic vaccines. Hit and run viruses evade immune destruction by infecting new hosts and rarely persist. Hit and stay viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine escape, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic change. Twelve prophylactic vaccines against hit and run agents exist, and there are only three vaccines against hit and stay viruses, all of which are of DNA composition. Several new vaccines against hit and stay viruses are feasible, but protective vaccines against RNA HIV and hepatitis C agents are highly unlikely, short of a major breakthrough. Therapeutic vaccines are very improbable without a magnitude of favorable new discoveries. In the meantime, antiviral chemotherapy, chemotherapy/prophylactic vaccination, and short interfering RNA silencing are worthy of intense investigation.},

abstract = {Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic information carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus involved in virtually all aspects of cellular development and maintenance. The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart, owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments. The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces, and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.},

Genome-wide screening using the 'Keio collection' to test sensitivity to colicins (col) A, B, D, E1, E2, E3, E7 and N from groups A and B, allowed identification of novel genes affecting cytotoxicity and provided new information on mechanisms of action. The requirement of lipopolysaccharide for colN cytotoxicity resides specifically in the lipopolysaccharide inner-core and first glucose. ColA cytotoxicity is dependent on gmhB and rffT genes, which function in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide and enterobacterial common antigen. Of the tol genes that function in the cytoplasmic membrane translocon, colE1 requires tolA and tolR but not tolQ for activity. Peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, which interacts with the Tol network, is not required for cytotoxicity of group A colicins. Except for TolQRA, no cytoplasmic membrane protein is essential for cytotoxicity of group A colicins, implying that TolQRA provides the sole pathway for their insertion into/through the cytoplasmic membrane. The periplasmic protease that cleaves between the receptor and catalytic domains of colE7 was not identified, implying either that the responsible gene is essential for cell viability, or that more than one gene product has the necessary proteolysis function.},

A number of different risk factors have been implicated in AD; however, neuritic (amyloid) plaques are considered as one of the defining risk factors and pathological hallmarks of the disease. In the past decade, enormous efforts have been devoted to understand the genetics and molecular pathogenesis leading to neuronal death in AD, which has been transferred into extensive experimental approaches aimed at reversing disease progression. Modern medicine is facing an increasing number of treatments available for vascular and neurodegenerative brain diseases, but no causal or neuroprotective treatment has yet been established. Almost all neurological conditions are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction, which, regardless of the pathogenetic mechanism, finally leads to neuronal death. The particular emphasis of this review is on risk factors and mechanisms resulting in neuronal loss in AD and current and prospective opportunities for therapeutic interventions. This review discusses these issues with a view to inspiring the development of new agents that could be useful for the treatment of AD. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The antibody also labeled isolated PHF that had been repeatedly washed with NaDodSO4. Dephosphorylation of the tissue sections with alkaline phosphatase prior to immunolabeling dramatically increased the number of tangles and plaques recognized by the antibody. The plaque core amyloid was not stained in either dephosphorylated or nondephosphorylated tissue sections. On immunoblots PHF polypeptides were labeled readily only when dephosphorylated. In contrast, a commercially available monoclonal antibody to a phosphorylated epitope of neurofilaments that labeled the tangles and the plaque neurites in tissue did not label any PHF polypeptides on immunoblots. The PHF polypeptides, labeled with the monoclonal antibody to tau, electrophoresed with those polypeptides recognized by antibodies to isolated PHF. The antibody to tau-labeled microtubules from normal human brains assembled in vitro but identically treated Alzheimer brain preparations had to be dephosphorylated to be completely recognized by this antibody.

abstract = {The alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family of enzymes is rapidly becoming one of the largest group of structurally related enzymes with diverse catalytic functions. Members in this family include acetylcholinesterase, dienelactone hydrolase, lipase, thioesterase, serine carboxypeptidase, proline iminopeptidase, proline oligopeptidase, haloalkane dehalogenase, haloperoxidase, epoxide hydrolase, hydroxynitrile lyase and others. The enzymes all have a Nucleophile-His-Acid catalytic triad evolved to efficiently operate on substrates with different chemical composition or physicochemical properties and in various biological contexts. For example, acetylcholine esterase catalyzes the cleavage of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, at a rate close to the limits of diffusion of substrate to the active site of the enzyme. Dienelactone hydrolase uses substrate-assisted catalysis to degrade aromatic compounds. Lipases act adsorbed at the water/lipid interface of their neutral water-insoluble ester substrates. Most lipases have their active site buried under secondary structure elements, a flap, which must change conformation to allow substrate to access the active site. Thioesterases are involved in a multitude of biochemical processes including bioluminiscence, fatty acid- and polyketide biosynthesis and metabolism. Serine carboxypeptidases recognize the negatively charged carboxylate terminus of their peptide substrates. Haloalkane dehalogenase is a detoxifying enzyme that converts halogenated aliphatics to the corresponding alcohols, while haloperoxidase catalyzes the halogenation of organic compounds. Hydroxynitrile lyase cleaves carbon-carbon bonds in cyanohydrins with concomitant hydrogen cyanide formation as a defense mechanism in plants. This paper gives an overview of catalytic activities reported for this family of enzymes by discussing selected examples. The current state of knowledge of the molecular basis for catalysis and substrate specificity is outlined. Relationships between active site anatomy, topology and conformational rearrangements in the protein molecule is discussed in the context of enzyme mechanism of action.},

abstract = {Is it possible to meaningfully comprehend the diversity of the viral world? We propose that it is. This is based on the observation that, although there is immense genomic variation, every infective virion is restricted by strict constraints in structure space (i.e., there are a limited number of ways to fold a protein chain, and only a small subset of these have the potential to construct a virion, the hallmark of a virus). We have previously suggested the use of structure for the higher-order classification of viruses, where genomic similarities are no longer observable. Here, we summarize the arguments behind this proposal, describe the current status of structural work, highlighting its power to infer common ancestry, and discuss the limitations and obstacles ahead of us. We also reflect on the future opportunities for a more concerted effort to provide high-throughput methods to facilitate the large-scale sampling of the virosphere.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Protein complexes are one of the keys to studying the behavior of a cell system. Many biological functions are carried out by protein complexes. During the past decade, the main strategy used to identify protein complexes from high-throughput network data has been to extract near-cliques or highly dense subgraphs from a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Although experimental PPI data has increased significantly over recent years, most PPI networks still have many false positive interactions and false negative edge loss due to the limitations of high-throughput experiments. In particular, the false negative errors restrict the search space of such conventional protein complex identification approaches. Thus, it has become one of the most challenging tasks in systems biology to automatically identify protein complexes. RESULTS In this work, we propose a new algorithm, NEOComplex (NECC- and Ortholog-based Complex identification by multiple network alignment), which integrates functional orthology information capable of being obtained by different types of MNA (multiple network alignment) approaches to expand the search space of protein complex detection. As part of our approach, we also define a new edge clustering coefficient to assign weight to interaction edges in PPI networks so that protein complexes can be identified more accurately.The edge clustering coefficient is based on the intuition that there is functional information captured in the common neighbors of the common neighbors as well. Our results show that the algorithm outperforms well-known protein complex identification tools in a balance between precision and recall on three eukaryotic species: human, yeast, and fly. As a result of MNAs of the species, the proposed approach can tolerate the edge loss of PPI networks and even discover sparse protein complexes which have traditionally been a challenge to predict.

Thanks to the Next Generation Sequencing efforts, an abundance of sequence data is now available to be processed for a range of bioinformatics applications. Embedding a biological sequence over a nucleotide or amino acid alphabet in a lower dimensional vector space makes the data more amenable for use by current machine learning tools, provided the quality of embedding is high and it captures the most meaningful information of the original sequences. Motivated by recent advances in the text document embedding literature, we present a new method, called seq2vec, to represent a complete biological sequence in an Euclidean space. The new representation has the potential to capture the contextual information of the original sequence necessary for sequence comparison tasks.

We found that a pentapeptide conserved in the N-terminal domain of all group A colicins, the 'TolA box', was important for colicin A import but was not involved in the colicin A-TolA interaction. It was, however, involved in the colicin A-TolB interaction. The interactions of colicin A N-terminal domain deletion mutants with TolA and TolB were investigated. Random mutagenesis was performed on a construct allowing the colicin A N-terminal domain to be exported in the bacteria periplasm. This enabled us to select mutant protein domains unable to compete with the wild-type domain of the entire colicin A for import into the cells. Our results demonstrate that different regions of the colicin A N-terminal domain interact with TolA and TolB.

abstract = {The analysis of the mutational landscape of cancer, including mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations, has been instrumental in studying the disease. We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun in which the relations between modules are enriched with mutual exclusivity while genes within each module are functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo which combines mutual exclusivity between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun which ensures co-occurrence between modules while the within module relations combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to the importance of the interaction between NCOR and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergetic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and metastasis related DCC gene.},

Our GCN predicts functions more accurately than Convolutional Neural Networks trained on sequence data alone and competing methods. Feature extraction via a language model removes the need for constructing multiple sequence alignments or feature engineering. Our model learns general structure-function relationships by robustly predicting functions of proteins with ≤ 30{\%} sequence identity to the training set. Using class activation mapping, we can automatically identify structural regions at the residue-level that lead to each function prediction for every protein confidently predicted, advancing site-specific function prediction. De-noising inherent in the trained model allows an only minor drop in performance when structure predictions are used, including multiple de novo protocols. We use our method to annotate all proteins in the PDB, making several new confident function predictions spanning both fold and function trees.},

abstract = {The adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein APMAP is expressed in the brain where it associates with $\gamma$-secretase, a protease responsible for the generation of the amyloid-$\beta$ peptides (A$\beta$) implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, behavioral investigations revealed spatial learning and memory deficiencies in our newly generated mouse line lacking the protein APMAP. In a mouse model of AD, the constitutive deletion of APMAP worsened the spatial memory phenotype and led to increased A$\beta$ production and deposition into senile plaques. To investigate at the molecular level the neurobiological functions of APMAP (memory and A$\beta$ formation) and a possible link with the pathological hallmarks of AD (memory impairment and A$\beta$ pathology), we next developed a procedure for the high-grade purification of cellular APMAP protein complexes. The biochemical characterization of these complexes revealed a series of new APMAP interactomers. Among these, the heat shock protein HSPA1A and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-M6PR) negatively regulated APP processing and A$\beta$ production, while clusterin, calnexin, arginase-1, PTGFRN and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR/IGF2R) positively regulated APP and A$\beta$ production. Several of the newly identified APMAP interactomers contribute to the autophagy-lysosome system, further supporting an emergent agreement that this pathway can modulate APP metabolism and A$\beta$ generation. Importantly, we have also demonstrated increased alternative splicing of APMAP and lowered levels of the A$\beta$ controllers HSPA1A and CD-M6PR in human brains from neuropathologically verified AD cases.},

We find that these neurotoxic oligomers do not have the beta-sheet structure characteristic of fibrils. Rather, the oligomers are composed of loosely aggregated strands whose C termini are protected from solvent exchange and which have a turn conformation, placing Phe19 in contact with Leu34. On the basis of NMR spectroscopy, we show that the structural conversion of Abeta42 oligomers to fibrils involves the association of these loosely aggregated strands into beta-sheets whose individual beta-strands polymerize in a parallel, in-register orientation and are staggered at an intermonomer contact between Gln15 and Gly37.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses. The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources of structural information provided an architectural framework for the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources. Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

abstract = {Unlike the dominant role of one class II invariant chain peptide (CLIP) in blocking MHC class II, comparative lipidomics analysis shows that human cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d bind lipids corresponding to hundreds of diverse accurate mass retention time values. Although most ions were observed in association with several CD1 proteins, ligands binding selectively to one CD1 isoform allowed the study of how differing antigen-binding grooves influence lipid capture. Although the CD1b groove is distinguished by its unusually large volume (2,200 {\AA}(3)) and the T' tunnel, the average mass of compounds eluted from CD1b was similar to that of lipids from CD1 proteins with smaller grooves. Elution of small ligands from the large CD1b groove might be explained if two small lipids bind simultaneously in the groove. Crystal structures indicate that all CD1 proteins can capture one antigen with its hydrophilic head group exposed for T-cell recognition, but CD1b structures show scaffold lipids seated below the antigen. We found that ligands selectively associated with CD1b lacked the hydrophilic head group that is generally needed for antigen recognition but interferes with scaffold function. Furthermore, we identified the scaffolds as deoxyceramides and diacylglycerols and directly demonstrate a function in augmenting presentation of a small glycolipid antigen to T cells. Thus, unlike MHC class II, CD1 proteins capture highly diverse ligands in the secretory pathway. CD1b has a mechanism for presenting either two small or one large lipid, allowing presentation of antigens with an unusually broad range of chain lengths.},

abstract = {Background: HH-suite is a widely used open source software suite for sensitive sequence similarity searches and protein fold recognition. It is based on pairwise alignment of profile Hidden Markov models (HMMs), which represent multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins. Results: We developed a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) vectorized implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for profile HMM alignment and introduced various other speed-ups. These accelerated the search methods HHsearch by a factor 4 and HHblits by a factor 2 over the previous version 2.0.16. HHblits3 is 10× faster than PSI-BLAST and 20× faster than HMMER3. Jobs to perform HHsearch and HHblits searches with many query profile HMMs can be parallelized over cores and over cluster servers using OpenMP and message passing interface (MPI). The free, open-source, GPLv3-licensed software is available at https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite. Conclusion: The added functionalities and increased speed of HHsearch and HHblits should facilitate their use in large-scale protein structure and function prediction, e.g. in metagenomics and genomics projects.},

abstract = {We investigated whether combined treatment with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and trastuzumab could enhance the specific killing of cells that overexpress the erbB-2 receptor. The combination resulted in an enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in all cell lines overexpressing erbB-2 receptor compared with either reagent alone. In contrast, there was no effect in cell lines with low levels of the erb-B2 receptor. Trastuzumab treatment resulted in down-regulation of the erbB-2 receptor in all erbB-2-overexpressing cell lines. Similar enhancement of TRAIL toxicity was observed when the erbB-2 receptor was down-regulated using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Down-regulation of the erbB-2 receptor protein by trastuzumab or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides decreased Akt kinase activation but not mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Down-regulation of Akt kinase activity by a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) also resulted in enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Expression of a constitutively active form of Akt kinase in an erbB-2-overexpressing cell line completely abrogated the increase in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by trastuzumab and significantly reduced the biological effect of either reagent alone. Therefore, down-regulation of the erbB-2 receptor by trastuzumab enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting Akt kinase activity. These data suggest that the combination of trastuzumab and TRAIL may allow enhanced therapeutic efficacy and specificity in the treatment of erbB-2-overexpressing tumors.},

abstract = {Several thousand human genes, amounting to about one-third of the whole genome, are potential targets for regulation by the several hundred microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded in the genome. The regulation occurs posttranscriptionally and involves the approximately 21-nucleotide miRNA interacting with a target site in the mRNA that generally has imperfect complementarity to the miRNA. The target sites are almost invariably in the 3'-untranslated region of the messenger RNA (mRNA), often in multiple copies. Metazoan miRNAs were previously thought to down-regulate protein expression by inhibiting target mRNA translation at some stage after the translation initiation step, without much effect on mRNA abundance. However, recent studies have questioned these suppositions. With some targets, an increase in the rate of mRNA degradation by the normal decay pathway contributes to the decrease in protein expression. miRNAs can also inhibit translation initiation, specifically the function of the cap-binding initiation factor, eIF4E. Repressed target mRNAs as well as miRNAs themselves accumulate in cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies, where many enzymes involved in mRNA degradation are concentrated. However, P-bodies may also serve as repositories for the temporary and reversible storage of untranslated mRNA, and reducing the expression (knockdown) of several distinct P-body protein components can alleviate miRNA-mediated repression of gene expression.},

Assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes but were substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below family level. Parameter settings markedly affected performance, underscoring their importance for program reproducibility.

Therefore, a critical step toward understanding the integrated workings of the cell is to determine the structure of protein complexes, and reveal how their structural organization dictates function. Studying the three-dimensional organization of protein assemblies, however, represents a major challenge for structural biologists, due to the large size of the complexes, their heterogeneous composition, their flexibility, and their asymmetric structure. In the last decade, mass spectrometry has proven to be a valuable tool for analyzing such noncovalent complexes. Here, I illustrate the breadth of structural information that can be obtained from this approach, and the steps taken to elucidate the stoichiometry, topology, packing, dynamics, and shape of protein complexes. In addition, I illustrate the challenges that lie ahead, and the future directions toward which the field might be heading.},

The crystal structure of the NSS homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus revealed one leucine substrate in an occluded, centrally located (S1) binding site next to two Na(+) ions. Computational studies combined with binding and flux experiments identified a second substrate (S2) site and a molecular mechanism of Na(+)-substrate symport that depends upon the allosteric interaction of substrate molecules in the two high-affinity sites. Here we show that the S2 site, which has not yet been identified by crystallographic approaches, can be blocked during preparation of detergent-solubilized LeuT, thereby obscuring its crucial role in Na(+)-coupled symport. This finding points to the need for caution in selecting experimental environments in which the properties and mechanistic features of membrane proteins can be delineated.},

Here we show that ATM is held inactive in unirradiated cells as a dimer or higher-order multimer, with the kinase domain bound to a region surrounding serine 1981 that is contained within the previously described 'FAT' domain. Cellular irradiation induces rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of serine 1981 that causes dimer dissociation and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Most ATM molecules in the cell are rapidly phosphorylated on this site after doses of radiation as low as 0.5 Gy, and binding of a phosphospecific antibody is detectable after the introduction of only a few DNA double-strand breaks in the cell. Activation of the ATM kinase seems to be an initiating event in cellular responses to irradiation, and our data indicate that ATM activation is not dependent on direct binding to DNA strand breaks, but may result from changes in the structure of chromatin.},

Here we show how the K+ channel displaces water molecules around an ion at its extracellular entryway, and how it holds a K+ ion in a square antiprism of water molecules in a cavity near its intracellular entryway. Carbonyl oxygen atoms within the selectivity filter form a very similar square antiprism around each K+ binding site, as if to mimic the waters of hydration. The selectivity filter changes its ion coordination structure in low K+ solutions. This structural change is crucial to the operation of the selectivity filter in the cellular context, where the K+ ion concentration near the selectivity filter varies in response to channel gating.},

abstract = {Males are predicted to compete for reproductive opportunities, with sexual selection driving the evolution of large body size and weaponry through the advantage they confer for access to females. Few studies have explored potential trade-offs of investment in secondary sexual traits between different components of fitness or tested for sexually antagonistic selection pressures. These factors may provide explanations for observed polymorphisms in both form and quality of secondary sexual traits. We report here an analysis of selection on horn phenotype in a feral population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland. Soay sheep display a phenotypic polymorphism for horn type with males growing either normal or reduced (scurred) horns, and females growing either normal, scurred, or no (polled) horns; further variation in size exists within horn morphs. We show that horn phenotype and the size of the trait displayed is subject to different selection pressures in males and females, generating sexually antagonistic selection. Furthermore, there was evidence of a trade-off between breeding success and longevity in normal-horned males, with both the normal horn type and larger horn size being associated with greater annual breeding success but reduced longevity. Therefore, selection through lifetime breeding success was not found to act upon horn phenotype in males. In females, a negative association of annual breeding success within the normal-horned phenotype did not result in a significant difference in lifetime fitness when compared to scurred individuals, as no significant difference in longevity was found. However, increased horn size within this group was negatively associated with breeding success and longevity. Females without horns (polled) suffered reduced longevity and thus reduced lifetime breeding success relative the other horn morphs. Our results therefore suggest that trade-offs between different components of fitness and antagonistic selection between the sexes may maintain genetic variation for secondary sexual traits within a population.},

abstract = {The RB gene product is a nuclear phosphoprotein that undergoes cell cycle-dependent changes in its phosphorylation status. To test whether RB regulates cell cycle progression, purified RB proteins, either full-length or a truncated form containing the T antigen-binding region, were injected into cells. Injection of either protein early in G1 inhibits progression into S phase. Co-injection of anti-RB antibodies antagonizes this effect. Injection of RB into cells arrested at G1/S or late in G1 has no effect on BrdU incorporation, suggesting that RB does not inhibit DNA synthesis in S phase. These results indicate that RB regulates cell proliferation by restricting cell cycle progression at a specific point in G1 and establish a biological assay for RB activity. Neither co-injection of RB with a T antigen peptide nor injection into cells expressing T antigen prevents cells from progressing into S phase, which supports the hypothesis that T antigen binding has functional consequences for RB.},

abstract = {Many proteins are translocated through the SecY channel in bacteria and archaea and through the related Sec61 channel in eukaryotes. The channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow constriction approximately halfway across the membrane, formed by a pore ring of amino acids. While the cytoplasmic cavity of the channel is empty, the extracellular cavity is filled with a short helix called the plug, which moves out of the way during protein translocation. The mechanism by which the channel transports large polypeptides and yet prevents the passage of small molecules, such as ions or metabolites, has been controversial. Here, we have addressed this issue in intact Escherichia coli cells by testing the permeation of small molecules through wild-type and mutant SecY channels, which are either in the resting state or contain a defined translocating polypeptide chain. We show that in the resting state, the channel is sealed by both the pore ring and the plug domain. During translocation, the pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain, preventing the permeation of small molecules. The structural conservation of the channel in all organisms indicates that this may be a universal mechanism by which the membrane barrier is maintained during protein translocation.},

abstract = {Plants have an unusual plastid-localized NADP-thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) containing both an NADP-thioredoxin reductase (NTR) and a thioredoxin (Trx) domain in a single polypeptide. Although NTRC is known to supply reductant for detoxifying hydrogen peroxide in the dark, its other functions are unknown. We now report that NTRC plays a previously unrecognized role in the redox regulation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), a central enzyme of starch synthesis. When supplied NADPH, NTRC activated AGPase in vitro in a redox reaction that required the active site cysteines of both domains of the enzyme. In leaves, AGPase was activated in planta either by light or external feeding of sucrose in the dark. Leaves of an Arabidopsis NTRC KO mutant showed a decrease both in the extent of redox activation of AGPase and in the enhancement of starch synthesis either in the light (by 40-60{\%}) or in the dark after treatment with external sucrose (by almost 100{\%}). The light-dependent activation of AGPase in isolated chloroplasts, by contrast, was unaffected. In nonphotosynthetic tissue (roots), KO of NTRC decreased redox activation of AGPase and starch synthesis in response to light or external sucrose by almost 90{\%}. The results provide biochemical and genetic evidence for a role of NTRC in regulating starch synthesis in response to either light or sucrose. The data also suggest that the Trx domain of NTRC and, to a lesser extent, free Trxs linked to ferredoxin enable amyloplasts of distant sink tissues to sense light used in photosynthesis by leaf chloroplasts and adjust heterotrophic starch synthesis accordingly.},

Pyphe is versatile and processes fitness data from colony sizes, viability scores from phloxine B staining or colony growth curves, all obtained with inexpensive transilluminating flatbed scanners. We apply pyphe to show that the fitness information contained in late endpoint measurements of colony sizes is similar to maximum growth slopes from time series. We phenotype gene-deletion strains of fission yeast in 59,350 individual fitness assays in 70 conditions, revealing that colony size and viability provide complementary, independent information. Viability scores obtained from quantifying the redness of phloxine-stained colonies accurately reflect the fraction of live cells within colonies. Pyphe is user-friendly, open-source and fully-documented, illustrated by applications to diverse fitness analysis scenarios.},

@article{Blomberg2014,
abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is a superfamily of membrane bound enzymes catalyzing the exergonic reduction of molecular oxygen to water, producing an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The gradient is formed both by the electrogenic chemistry, taking electrons and protons from opposite sides of the membrane, and by proton pumping across the entire membrane. In the most efficient subfamily, the A-family of oxidases, one proton is pumped in each reduction step, which is surprising considering the fact that two of the reduction steps most likely are only weakly exergonic. Based on a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental information, it is here shown that from both a thermodynamic and a kinetic point of view, it should be possible to pump one proton per electron also with such an uneven distribution of the free energy release over the reduction steps, at least up to half the maximum gradient. A previously suggested pumping mechanism is developed further to suggest a reason for the use of two proton transfer channels in the A-family. Since the rate of proton transfer to the binuclear center through the D-channel is redox dependent, it might become too slow for the steps with low exergonicity. Therefore, a second channel, the K-channel, where the rate is redox-independent is needed. A redox-dependent leakage possibility is also suggested, which might be important for efficient energy conservation at a high gradient. A mechanism for the variation in proton pumping stoichiometry over the different subfamilies of cytochrome oxidase is also suggested.

So naturally, applying deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insights from data is under the spotlight of both the academia and the industry. This article reviews some research of deep learning in bioinformatics. To provide a big picture, we categorized the research by both bioinformatics domains (i.e., omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architectures (i.e., deep neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, modified neural network) as well as present brief descriptions of each work. Additionally, we introduce a few issues of deep learning in bioinformatics such as problems of class imbalance data and suggest future research directions such as multimodal deep learning. We believe that this paper could provide valuable insights and be a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning in their bioinformatics studies.},

In bacteria, the structure of the outer membrane porin protein family of $\beta$-barrels is generally characterized by an even number of $\beta$-strands; usually 14, 16 or 18 strands are observed forming the bacterial porin barrel wall. In contrast, the recent structures of the mitochondrial porin, also known as VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel), show an uneven number of 19 $\beta$-strands, but a similar molecular architecture. Despite the lack of a clear evolutionary link between these protein families, their common principles and differences in assembly, architecture and function are summarized in the present review.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory factors in mammalian genomics. A number of reports within the last 2 years have identified thousands of actively expressed long ncRNA transcripts with distinct properties. The long ncRNAs show differential expression patterns and regulation in a wide variety of cells and tissues, adding significant complexity to the understanding of their biological role. Furthermore, genome-wide studies of transcriptional enhancers based on chromatin modifications and enhancer binding proteins have led to the identification of putative enhancers and provided insight into their tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. In an exciting turn of events, new evidence is indicating that long ncRNAs are associated with enhancer regions and that such non-coding transcription correlate with the increased activity of the neighboring genes. Moreover, additional experiments suggest that enhancer-function can be mediated through a transcribed long ncRNA and that this might be a common function for long ncRNAs. Here, we review recent advances made both in the genome-wide characterization of enhancers and in the identification of new classes of long ncRNAs, and discuss the functional overlap of these two classes of regulatory elements.},

The extensive usage of plastics results in a tremendous amount of waste, which has become a severe burden on the environment. Several degradation approaches exist in nature to cope with ever-increasing plastic waste. Among these approaches, biodegradation by microorganisms has emerged as a natural way, which is favored by many environmentally conscious societies. To facilitate the study on biodegradation of plastics, we developed an online resource, Plastics Microbial Biodegradation Database (PMBD), to gather and present the information about microbial biodegradation of plastics. In this database, 949 microorganisms-plastics relationships and 79 genes involved in the biodegradation of plastics were manually collected and confirmed through literature searching. In addition, more than 8000 automatically annotated enzyme sequences, which were predicted to be involved in the plastics biodegradation, were extracted from the TrEMBL section of the UniProt database. The PMBD database is presented with a website at http://pmbd.genome-mining.cn/home. Data may be accessed through browsing or searching. Also included on the website are a sequence alignment tool and a function prediction tool.},

We have previously shown that complement plays a vital role in the efficient phagocytosis of a serotype 5 S. aureus strain and that the opsonic fragments of the central complement protein C3, C3b and iC3b, were present on the bacterial surface after incubation in human serum. In the present studies, C3b and iC3b were found on several serotype 5 and 8 S. aureus strains after incubation in human serum. Using purified classical activation pathway complement proteins and the Western blot assay, we showed that when C3b was generated on the S. aureus surface no iC3b fragments were found, suggesting that other serum proteins may be required for cleaving C3b to iC3b. When C3b-coated S. aureus was incubated with serum factor I, a complement regulatory protein, iC3b was generated. Purified factor H, a serum protein cofactor for factor I, did not enhance factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b. These findings suggest that C3b cleavage to iC3b on S. aureus is mediated by serum factor I and does not require factor H.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis inhibitory protein of staphylococci (CHIPS) and Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) are small, excreted molecules that play a crucial role in the staphylococcal defence against the human innate immune system. Here we show that they both counteract crucial acute responses of our immune system such as complement activation, neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophil activation. By studying gene expression via promoter-green fluorescent protein fusions, Northern blots and protein expression analyses, we show that SCIN and CHIPS are produced during the early (exponential) growth stages. Although the SCIN and CHIPS genes are expressed simultaneously, they are differently regulated by various Staphylococcus aureus regulatory loci. However, the sae locus is crucial for upregulation of both SCIN and CHIPS. This is the first study that presents the expression of two extracellular S. aureus proteins early during growth. Because SCIN and CHIPS are both efficient modulators of neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis and killing, their early expression is necessary for efficient modulation of the early immune response.},

To systematically understand splicing regulation, we conducted an unbiased screen and identified {\textgreater}100 intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs), clustered by sequence similarity. All ISEs functioned in multiple cell types and in heterologous introns, and patterns of distribution and conservation across pre-mRNA regions were similar to those of exonic splicing silencers. Consistently, all ISEs inhibited use of splice sites from exons. Putative trans-factors of each ISE group were identified and validated. Five distinct groups were recognized by hnRNP H and hnRNP F, whose C-terminal domains were sufficient to render context-dependent activities of ISEs. The sixth group was controlled by factors that either activate or suppress splicing. We provide a comprehensive picture of general ISE activities and suggest new models of how single elements can function oppositely, depending on locations and binding factors.},

abstract = {This is the first report of a full genome scan of sexual orientation in men. A sample of 456 individuals from 146 families with two or more gay brothers was genotyped with 403 microsatellite markers at 10-cM intervals. Given that previously reported evidence of maternal loading of transmission of sexual orientation could indicate epigenetic factors acting on autosomal genes, maximum likelihood estimations (mlod) scores were calculated separated for maternal, paternal, and combined transmission. The highest mlod score was 3.45 at a position near D7S798 in 7q36 with approximately equivalent maternal and paternal contributions. The second highest mlod score of 1.96 was located near D8S505 in 8p12, again with equal maternal and paternal contributions. A maternal origin effect was found near marker D10S217 in 10q26, with a mlod score of 1.81 for maternal meioses and no paternal contribution. We did not find linkage to Xq28 in the full sample, but given the previously reported evidence of linkage in this region, we conducted supplemental analyses to clarify these findings. First, we re-analyzed our previously reported data and found a mlod of 6.47. We then re-analyzed our current data, after limiting the sample to those families previously reported, and found a mlod of 1.99. These Xq28 findings are discussed in detail. The results of this first genome screen for normal variation in the behavioral trait of sexual orientation in males should encourage efforts to replicate these findings in new samples with denser linkage maps in the suggested regions.},

abstract = {Splicing of short introns by the nuclear pre-mRNA splicing machinery is thought to proceed via an "intron definition" mechanism, in which the 5' and 3' splice sites (5'ss, 3'ss, respectively) are initially recognized and paired across the intron. Here, we describe a computational analysis of sequence features involved in recognition of short introns by using available transcript data from five eukaryotes with complete or nearly complete genomic sequences. The information content of five different transcript features was measured by using methods from information theory, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine the amount of information required for accurate recognition of short introns in each organism. We conclude: (i) that short introns in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans contain essentially all of the information for their recognition by the splicing machinery, and computer programs that simulate splicing specificity can predict the exact boundaries of approximately 95{\%} of short introns in both organisms; (ii) that in yeast, the 5'ss, branch signal, and 3'ss can accurately identify intron locations but do not precisely determine the location of 3' cleavage in every intron; and (iii) that the 5'ss, branch signal, and 3'ss are not sufficient to accurately identify short introns in plant and human transcripts, but that specific subsets of candidate intronic enhancer motifs can be identified in both human and Arabidopsis that contribute dramatically to the accuracy of splicing simulators.},

abstract = {Immunity proteins inhibit colicins, protein toxins released by bacteria during times of environmental stress, by binding and inactivating their cytotoxic domains. This protects the producing organism as it attempts to kill off competing bacteria. The cytotoxic domains of related colicins share a high degree of sequence identity, as do their corresponding immunity proteins, yet specificity and affinity are also high, with little non-cognate biological cross-protection evident under physiological conditions. We review recent work on DNase-specific immunity proteins, which shows that, although both cognate and non-cognate proteins can bind a single toxin, their affinities can differ by as much as 12 orders of magnitude. We have termed this mode of binding dual recognition, because the DNase-binding surface of an immunity protein is made up of two components, one conserved and the other variable. The strength of the binding interaction is dominated by the conserved residues, while neighbouring variable residues control specificity. Similar dual recognition systems may exist in other biological contexts, particularly where a protein must discriminate the right binding partner from numerous, structurally homologous alternatives.},

abstract = {Redox signals generated by the photosynthetic electron transport chain are known to be involved in regulating the Calvin cycle, ATP synthesis, and NADPH export from chloroplasts in response to light. The signal cascade involves transfer of electrons from photosystem I via the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system to target enzymes that are activated by reduction of regulatory disulphide bonds. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent findings showing that this concept can be extended to the regulation of carbon storage and partitioning in plants. Starch is the major carbon store in plants, and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is the key regulatory enzyme of starch synthesis in the plastid. It has been shown that AGPase from potato tubers is subject to post-translational redox modification, and here experimental data will be provided showing that the isozyme from pea leaf chloroplasts is activated by reduced thioredoxin f or m in a similar way. Recent reports will be summarized providing in planta evidence that this mechanism regulates storage starch synthesis in response to light and sugars. Post-translational redox activation of AGPase in response to sugars is part of a signalling mechanism linking the rate of starch synthesis to the availability of carbon in diverse plant tissues. Some of the components of the signalling pathway reporting changes in the cytosolic sugar status to the plastid have been postulated, but detailed work is in progress to confirm the exact mode of action. Recent evidence will be discussed showing that key enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and ammonium assimilation (glutamine synthetase and glutamine:oxoglutarate amino transferase) are regulated by reversible disulphide-bond formation similar to AGPase. Redox regulation is proposed to be the preferred strategy of plastidial enzymes to regulate various metabolic processes such as carbon fixation, starch metabolism, lipid synthesis, and amino acid synthesis in response to physiological and environmental inputs.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria inhabit a broad range of ecological niches. For Escherichia coli, this includes river water as well as humans and animals, where it can be both a commensal and a pathogen. Intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure that bacteria have the right complement of $\beta$-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to enable adaptation to a particular habitat. Yet no mechanism is known for replacing OMPs in the outer membrane, an issue that is further confounded by the lack of an energy source and the high stability and abundance of OMPs. Here we uncover the process underpinning OMP turnover in E. coli and show it to be passive and binary in nature, in which old OMPs are displaced to the poles of growing cells as new OMPs take their place. Using fluorescent colicins as OMP-specific probes, in combination with ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo and in vitro, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, we established the mechanism for binary OMP partitioning. OMPs clustered to form ∼0.5-$\mu$m diameter islands, where their diffusion is restricted by promiscuous interactions with other OMPs. OMP islands were distributed throughout the cell and contained the Bam complex, which catalyses the insertion of OMPs in the outer membrane. However, OMP biogenesis occurred as a gradient that was highest at mid-cell but largely absent at cell poles. The cumulative effect is to push old OMP islands towards the poles of growing cells, leading to a binary distribution when cells divide. Hence, the outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium is a spatially and temporally organized structure, and this organization lies at the heart of how OMPs are turned over in the membrane.},

abstract = {Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) is a particularly aggressive form of Alzheimer's disease, with a median survival time of 7-10 months after diagnosis. Why these patients have such a rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease is currently unknown. To further understand pathological differences between rpAD and typical sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) we used localized proteomics to analyze the protein differences in amyloid plaques in rpAD and sAD. Label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS was performed on amyloid plaques microdissected from rpAD and sAD patients (n = 22 for each patient group) and protein expression differences were quantified. On average, 913 ± 30 (mean ± SEM) proteins were quantified in plaques from each patient and 279 of these proteins were consistently found in plaques from every patient. We found significant differences in protein composition between rpAD and sAD plaques. We found that rpAD plaques contained significantly higher levels of neuronal proteins (p = 0.0017) and significantly lower levels of astrocytic proteins (p = 1.08 × 10(-6)). Unexpectedly, cumulative protein differences in rpAD plaques did not suggest accelerated typical sAD. Plaques from patients with rpAD were particularly abundant in synaptic proteins, especially those involved in synaptic vesicle release, highlighting the potential importance of synaptic dysfunction in the accelerated development of plaque pathology in rpAD. Combined, our data provide new direct evidence that amyloid plaques do not all have the same protein composition and that the proteomic differences in plaques could provide important insight into the factors that contribute to plaque development. The cumulative protein differences in rpAD plaques suggest rpAD may be a novel subtype of Alzheimer's disease.},

The associations in STRING include direct (physical) interactions, as well as indirect (functional) interactions, as long as both are specific and biologically meaningful. Apart from collecting and reassessing available experimental data on protein-protein interactions, and importing known pathways and protein complexes from curated databases, interaction predictions are derived from the following sources: (i) systematic co-expression analysis, (ii) detection of shared selective signals across genomes, (iii) automated text-mining of the scientific literature and (iv) computational transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on gene orthology. In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework. Further improvements include automated background analysis of user inputs for functional enrichments, and streamlined download options. The STRING resource is available online, at http://string-db.org/.},

By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9{\%} of which had been recycled, 12{\%} was incinerated, and 79{\%} was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

abstract = {When collecting X-ray diffraction data from a crystal, we measure the intensities of the diffracted waves scattered from a series of planes that we can imagine slicing through the crystal in all directions. From these intensities we derive the amplitudes of the scattered waves, but in the experiment we lose the phase information; that is, how we offset these waves when we add them together to reconstruct an image of our molecule. This is generally known as the 'phase problem'. We can only derive the phases from some knowledge of the molecular structure. In small-molecule crystallography, some basic assumptions about atomicity give rise to relationships between the amplitudes from which phase information can be extracted. In protein crystallography, these ab initio methods can only be used in the rare cases in which there are data to at least 1.2 A resolution. For the majority of cases in protein crystallography phases are derived either by using the atomic coordinates of a structurally similar protein (molecular replacement) or by finding the positions of heavy atoms that are intrinsic to the protein or that have been added (methods such as MIR, MIRAS, SIR, SIRAS, MAD, SAD or combinations of these). The pioneering work of Perutz, Kendrew, Blow, Crick and others developed the methods of isomorphous replacement: adding electron-dense atoms to the protein without disturbing the protein structure. Nowadays, methods from small-molecule crystallography can be used to find the heavy-atom substructure and the phases for the whole protein can be bootstrapped from this prior knowledge. More recently, improved X-ray sources, detectors and software have led to the routine use of anomalous scattering to obtain phase information from either incorporated selenium or intrinsic sulfurs. In the best cases, only a single set of X-ray data (SAD) is required to provide the positions of the anomalous scatters, which together with density-modification procedures can reveal the structure of the complete protein.},

The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or HMMs). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. The PANTHER website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of PANTHER (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability. This protocol provides a detailed description of how to analyze genome-wide experimental data with the PANTHER classification system.},

abstract = {Transcriptional and allosteric regulation of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) plays a major role in the regulation of starch synthesis. Analysis of the response after detachment of growing potato tubers from the mother plant revealed that this concept requires extension. Starch synthesis was inhibited within 24 h of tuber detachment, even though the catalytic subunit of AGPase (AGPB) and overall AGPase activity remained high, the substrates ATP and Glc-1-P increased, and the glycerate-3-phosphate/inorganic orthophosphate (the allosteric activator and inhibitor, respectively) ratio increased. This inhibition was abolished in transformants in which a bacterial AGPase replaced the potato AGPase. Measurements of the subcellular levels of each metabolite between Suc and starch established AGPase as the only step whose substrates increase and mass action ratio decreases after detachment of wild-type tubers. Separation of extracts on nonreducing SDS gels revealed that AGPB is present as a mixture of monomers and dimers in growing tubers and becomes dimerized completely in detached tubers. Dimerization led to inactivation of the enzyme as a result of a marked decrease of the substrate affinity and sensitivity to allosteric effectors. Dimerization could be reversed and AGPase reactivated in vitro by incubating extracts with DTT. Incubation of tuber slices with DTT or high Suc levels reduced dimerization, increased AGPase activation, and stimulated starch synthesis in vivo. In intact tubers, the Suc content correlated strongly with AGPase activation across a range of treatments, including tuber detachment, aging of the mother plant, heterologous overexpression of Suc phosphorylase, and antisense inhibition of endogenous AGPase activity. Furthermore, activation of AGPase resulted in a stimulation of starch synthesis and decreased levels of glycolytic intermediates.},

abstract = {Cross-validation is a mainstay for measuring performance and progress in machine learning. There are subtle differences in how exactly to compute accuracy, F-measure and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in cross-validation studies. However, these details are not discussed in the literature, and incompatible methods are used by various papers and software packages. This leads to inconsistency across the research literature. Anomalies in performance calculations for particular folds and situations go undiscovered when they are buried in aggregated results over many folds and datasets, without ever a person looking at the intermediate performance measurements. This research note clarifies and illustrates the differences, and it provides guidance for how best to measure classification performance under cross-validation. In particular, there are several divergent methods used for computing F-measure, which is often recommended as a performance measure under class imbalance, e.g., for text classification domains and in one-vs.-all reductions of datasets having many classes. We show by experiment that all but one of these computation methods leads to biased measurements, especially under high class imbalance. This paper is of particular interest to those designing machine learning software libraries and researchers focused on high class imbalance.},

abstract = {Ab initio gene identification in the genomic sequence of Drosophila melanogaster was obtained using (human gene predictor) and Fgenesh programs that have organism-specific parameters for human, Drosophila, plants, yeast, and nematode. We did not use information about cDNA/EST in most predictions to model a real situation for finding new genes because information about complete cDNA is often absent or based on very small partial fragments. We investigated the accuracy of gene prediction on different levels and designed several schemes to predict an unambiguous set of genes (annotation CGG1), a set of reliable exons (annotation CGG2), and the most complete set of exons (annotation CGG3). For 49 genes, protein products of which have clear homologs in protein databases, predictions were recomputed by Fgenesh+ program. The first annotation serves as the optimal computational description of new sequence to be presented in a database. Reliable exons from the second annotation serve as good candidates for selecting the PCR primers for experimental work for gene structure verification. Our results shows that we can identify approximately 90{\%} of coding nucleotides with 20{\%} false positives. At the exon level we accurately predicted 65{\%} of exons and 89{\%} including overlapping exons with 49{\%} false positives. Optimizing accuracy of prediction, we designed a gene identification scheme using Fgenesh, which provided sensitivity (Sn) = 98{\%} and specificity (Sp) = 86{\%} at the base level, Sn = 81{\%} (97{\%} including overlapping exons) and Sp = 58{\%} at the exon level and Sn = 72{\%} and Sp = 39{\%} at the gene level (estimating sensitivity on std1 set and specificity on std3 set). In general, these results showed that computational gene prediction can be a reliable tool for annotating new genomic sequences, giving accurate information on 90{\%} of coding sequences with 14{\%} false positives. However, exact gene prediction (especially at the gene level) needs additional improvement using gene prediction algorithms. The program was also tested for predicting genes of human Chromosome 22 (the last variant of Fgenesh can analyze the whole chromosome sequence). This analysis has demonstrated that the 88{\%} of manually annotated exons in Chromosome 22 were among the ab initio predicted exons.

An estimate of the abundance of each protein, based on the three most intense peptide ions, shows that the quantified species vary in concentration over a factor of ∼103. Compared to initial studies in the field of Drosophila proteomics, our current results show an eight-fold higher temporal protein coverage with increased quantitative accuracy. Across the lifespan, we observe a range of trends in the abundance of different proteins, including: an increase in abundance of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle; a decrease in proteasomal proteins, as well as ribosomal proteins; and, many types of proteins, which remain relatively unchanged. For younger flies, proteomes are relatively similar within their age group. For older flies, proteome similarity decreases within their age group. These combined results illustrate a correlation between increasing age and decreasing proteostasis.},

The so-called neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS) is a lethal phenotype displaying features that are not seen in classical MFS. We have therefore studied the biosynthesis and extracellular deposition of Fib and decorin in fibroblasts from a patient with nMFS and controls. Immunofluorescence of the patient's cell cultures showed an almost complete absence of Fib and a marked reduction of decorin in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The nMFS skin revealed Fib on subbasal microfibrillar bundles in the papillary dermis, and Fib associated with elastic fibers in the reticular dermis; the bundles and fibers were fragmented and thinner than normal. Pulse-chase labeling of cells with [35S]Met/Cys revealed moderately reduced secretion, but a diminished deposition of Fib in the ECM; this was more apparent at a longer chase time. Fib mRNA and synthesis appeared to be normal, whereas both decorin mRNA and biosynthesis were reduced. We therefore assume a structural Fib defect in this patient causing reduced deposition into and/or enhanced removal from the ECM, whereas the reduced decorin biosynthesis may be a secondary regulatory phenomenon. The clinical relevance of this remains unclear. Our findings imply that Fib defects may be responsible for the severe, complex phenotype of nMFS.},

Understanding how functions and phenotypes are linked will be crucial for the development of methods for the automatic conversion of gene loss-of-function phenotypes to gene functional annotations. We explored the relation between cellular phenotypes from RNAi-based screens in human cells and gene annotations of cellular functions as provided by the Gene Ontology (GO). Comparing different similarity measures, we found that information content-based measures of phenotypic similarity were the best at capturing gene functional similarity. However, phenotypic similarities did not map to the Gene Ontology organization of gene function but to functions defined as groups of GO terms with shared gene annotations. Our observations have implications for the use and interpretation of phenotypic similarities as a proxy for gene functions both in RNAi screen data analysis and curation and in the prediction of disease genes.},

An important long-term goal in the splicing field is to determine a set of rules or "code" for splicing that will enable prediction of the splicing pattern of any primary transcript from its sequence. Outside of the core splice site motifs, the bulk of the information required for splicing is thought to be contained in exonic and intronic cis-regulatory elements that function by recruitment of sequence-specific RNA-binding protein factors that either activate or repress the use of adjacent splice sites. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of splicing cis-regulatory elements and their context-dependent effects on splicing, emphasizing recent global/genome-wide studies and open questions.},

abstract = {A major cause of aging and numerous diseases is thought to be cumulative oxidative stress, resulting from the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during respiration. Calorie restriction (CR), the most robust intervention to extend life span and ameliorate various diseases in mammals, reduces oxidative stress and damage. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the protective effects of CR on oxidative stress and damage are diminished in mice lacking SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase. SIRT3 reduces cellular ROS levels dependent on superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a major mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme. SIRT3 deacetylates two critical lysine residues on SOD2 and promotes its antioxidative activity. Importantly, the ability of SOD2 to reduce cellular ROS and promote oxidative stress resistance is greatly enhanced by SIRT3. Our studies identify a defense program that CR provokes to reduce oxidative stress and suggest approaches to combat aging and oxidative stress-related diseases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Within the class of integral membrane proteins, the bacterial porins display a remarkable resistance to denaturants and proteases. This stability is probably crucial for the formation of highly ordered, three-dimensional crystals. Structural analysis of these crystals has been possible in atomic detail. This analysis has revealed interesting features, such as the aromatic girdles, and has helped to explain several observations, including the porins' ability to discriminate between polar and non-polar solutes. Recent research has thus improved our understanding of the porins in a qualitative fashion.},

abstract = {Curli are extracellular amyloid fibres produced by Escherichia coli that are critical for biofilm formation and adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces. CsgA and CsgB are the major and minor curli subunits, respectively, while CsgE, CsgF and CsgG direct the extracellular localization and assembly of curli subunits into fibres. The secretion and stability of CsgA and CsgB are dependent on the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG. Here, we identified functional interactions between CsgG and CsgE during curli secretion. We discovered that CsgG overexpression restored curli production to a csgE strain under curli-inducing conditions. In antibiotic sensitivity and protein secretion assays, CsgG expression alone allowed translocation of erythromycin and small periplasmic proteins across the outer membrane. Coexpression of CsgE with CsgG blocked non-specific protein and antibiotic passage across the outer membrane. However, CsgE did not block secretion of proteins containing a 22-amino-acid putative outer membrane secretion signal of CsgA (A22). Finally, using purified proteins, we found that CsgE prohibited the self-assembly of CsgA into amyloid fibres. Collectively, these data indicate that CsgE provides substrate specificity to the curli secretion pore CsgG, and acts directly on the secretion substrate CsgA to prevent premature subunit assembly.},

We present algorithms (old and new) which perform clustering in this setting efficiently, both in an asymptotic worst-case analysis and from a practical point of view. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a new algorithm which is suitable for any distance update scheme and performs significantly better than the existing algorithms. (2) We prove the correctness of two algorithms by Rohlf and Murtagh, which is necessary in each case for different reasons. (3) We give well-founded recommendations for the best current algorithms for the various agglomerative clustering schemes.},

One class of ncRNA that is of particular interest is antisense RNAs, which are complementary to protein coding transcripts (mRNAs). In this article, we summarize recent studies using different yeasts that reveal a conserved pattern in which meiotically expressed genes have antisense transcripts in vegetative cells. These antisense transcripts repress the basal transcription of the mRNA during vegetative growth and are diminished as cells enter meiosis. While the mechanism(s) by which these antisense RNAs interfere with production of sense transcripts is not yet understood, the effects appear to be independent of the canonical RNAi machinery.},

abstract = {Colicins are protein toxins produced by Escherichia coli to kill related bacteria. They must cross the target cell outer membrane (OM), and some must also cross the inner membrane (IM). To accomplish cel-lular import, colicins have parasitized E. coli nutrient transporters as well as IM and periplasmic proteins normally used to maintain cell wall integrity or provide energy for nutrient uptake through transporters. Colicins have evolved to use both transporters and other membrane proteins through mechanisms different from those employed in phys-iological substrate uptake. Extended receptor-binding domains allow some colicins to search by lateral diffusion for binding sites on their OM translocators while bound to their primary OM receptor. Trans-port across the OM is initiated by entry of the unstructured N-terminal translocation domain into the translocator. Periplasmic and IM net-works subsequently accomplish insertion of the colicin cytotoxic do-main into or across the IM.},

In this chapter, we review the use of high-throughput technologies to systematically investigate biological systems in aging and longevity research, and discuss how these data can be analyzed to produce information that advances our understanding of such complex processes both in terms of variation in aging and longevity and in the context of molecular changes during the life course. A summary of various online sources of aging-related data is also presented, and the challenges when dealing with heterogeneity, statistical uncertainties, and integration of multiple types of data are discussed. Finally, we review computational methods available to researchers to make predictions that help guide experiments and better understand aging from a systems' perspective.},

With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.Conclusion: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/.

These advances in AD genetics are positioned in light of the current endeavor directing toward translational research and personalized treatment of AD. We discuss the current state of the art of AD genetics and address the implications and relevance of AD genetics in clinical diagnosis and risk prediction, distinguishing between monogenic and multifactorial AD. Furthermore, the potential and current limitations of molecular reclassification of AD to streamline clinical trials in drug development and biomarker studies are addressed.Genet Med 18 5, 421-430.},

M. alternifolia essential oil inhibited the conversion of C. albicans from yeast to the mycelial form at a concentration of 0.16{\%} (v/v). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 0.12{\%} to 0.50{\%} (v/v) for yeasts and 0.12{\%} to 1{\%} (v/v) for dermatophytes; the cytocidal activity was generally expressed at the same concentration.

abstract = {Background: The apolipoprotein-$\epsilon$4 allele (APOE-$\epsilon$4) is strongly associated with detrimental outcomes in affluent populations including atherosclerotic disease, Alzheimer's disease, and reduced lifespan. Despite these detrimental outcomes, population frequencies of APOE-$\epsilon$4 are high. We hypothesize that the high frequency of APOE-$\epsilon$4 was maintained because of beneficial effects during evolution when infectious pathogens were more prevalent and a major cause of mortality. We examined a rural Ghanaian population with a high pathogen exposure for selective advantages of APOE-$\epsilon$4, to survival and or fertility. Methods and findings: This rural Ghanaian population (n = 4311) has high levels of mortality from widespread infectious diseases which are the main cause of death. We examined whether APOE-$\epsilon$4 was associated with survival (total follow-up time was 30,262 years) and fertility after stratifying by exposure to high or low pathogen levels. Households drawing water from open wells and rivers were classified as exposed to high pathogen levels while low pathogen exposure was classified as those drawing water from borehole wells. We found a non-significant, but positive survival benefit, i.e. the hazard ratio per APOE-$\epsilon$4 allele was 0.80 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.69 to 1.05), adjusted for sex, tribe, and socioeconomic status. Among women aged 40 years and older (n = 842), APOE-$\epsilon$4 was not associated with the lifetime number of children. However, APOE-$\epsilon$4 was associated with higher fertility in women exposed to high pathogen levels. Compared with women not carrying an APOE-$\epsilon$4 allele, those carrying one APOE-$\epsilon$4 allele had on average one more child and those carrying two APOE-$\epsilon$4 alleles had 3.5 more children (p = 0.018). Conclusions: Contrary to affluent modern-day populations, APOE-$\epsilon$4 did not carry a survival disadvantage in this rural Ghanaian population. Moreover, APOE-$\epsilon$4 promotes fertility in highly infectious environments. Our findings suggest that APOE-$\epsilon$4 may be considered as evolutionarily adaptive. Its adverse associations in affluent modern populations with later onset diseases of aging further characterize APOE-$\epsilon$4 as an example of antagonistic pleiotropy.},

abstract = {Present estimates suggest that of the 359 million tons of plastics produced annually worldwide1, 150–200 million tons accumulate in landfill or in the natural environment2. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the most abundant polyester plastic, with almost 70 million tons manufactured annually worldwide for use in textiles and packaging3. The main recycling process for PET, via thermomechanical means, results in a loss of mechanical properties4. Consequently, de novo synthesis is preferred and PET waste continues to accumulate. With a high ratio of aromatic terephthalate units—which reduce chain mobility—PET is a polyester that is extremely difficult to hydrolyse5. Several PET hydrolase enzymes have been reported, but show limited productivity6,7. Here we describe an improved PET hydrolase that ultimately achieves, over 10 hours, a minimum of 90 per cent PET depolymerization into monomers, with a productivity of 16.7 grams of terephthalate per litre per hour (200 grams per kilogram of PET suspension, with an enzyme concentration of 3 milligrams per gram of PET). This highly efficient, optimized enzyme outperforms all PET hydrolases reported so far, including an enzyme8,9 from the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis strain 201-F6 (even assisted by a secondary enzyme10) and related improved variants11–14 that have attracted recent interest. We also show that biologically recycled PET exhibiting the same properties as petrochemical PET can be produced from enzymatically depolymerized PET waste, before being processed into bottles, thereby contributing towards the concept of a circular PET economy. Computer-aided engineering produces improvements to an enzyme that breaks down poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into its constituent monomers, which are used to synthesize PET of near-petrochemical grade that can be further processed into bottles.},

abstract = {We introduce a general probabilistic model of the gene structure of human genomic sequences which incorporates descriptions of the basic transcriptional, translational and splicing signals, as well as length distributions and compositional features of exons, introns and intergenic regions. Distinct sets of model parameters are derived to account for the many substantial differences in gene density and structure observed in distinct C + G compositional regions of the human genome. In addition, new models of the donor and acceptor splice signals are described which capture potentially important dependencies between signal positions. The model is applied to the problem of gene identification in a computer program, GENSCAN, which identifies complete exon/intron structures of genes in genomic DNA. Novel features of the program include the capacity to predict multiple genes in a sequence, to deal with partial as well as complete genes, and to predict consistent sets of genes occurring on either or both DNA strands. GENSCAN is shown to have substantially higher accuracy than existing methods when tested on standardized sets of human and vertebrate genes, with 75 to 80{\%} of exons identified exactly. The program is also capable of indicating fairly accurately the reliability of each predicted exon. Consistently high levels of accuracy are observed for sequences of differing C + G content and for distinct groups of vertebrates.},

abstract = {DNA damage is a key factor both in the evolution and treatment of cancer. Genomic instability is a common feature of cancer cells, fuelling accumulation of oncogenic mutations, while radiation and diverse genotoxic agents remain important, if imperfect, therapeutic modalities. Cellular responses to DNA damage are coordinated primarily by two distinct kinase signaling cascades, the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways, which are activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA respectively. Historically, these pathways were thought to act in parallel with overlapping functions; however, more recently it has become apparent that their relationship is more complex. In response to DSBs, ATM is required both for ATR-Chk1 activation and to initiate DNA repair via homologous recombination (HRR) by promoting formation of single-stranded DNA at sites of damage through nucleolytic resection. Interestingly, cells and organisms survive with mutations in ATM or other components required for HRR, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but at the cost of genomic instability and cancer predisposition. By contrast, the ATR-Chk1 pathway is the principal direct effector of the DNA damage and replication checkpoints and, as such, is essential for the survival of many, although not all, cell types. Remarkably, deficiency for HRR in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient tumors confers sensitivity to cisplatin and inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme required for repair of endogenous DNA damage. In addition, suppressing DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses by inhibiting Chk1 can enhance tumor cell killing by diverse genotoxic agents. Here, we review current understanding of the organization and functions of the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways and the prospects for targeting DNA damage signaling processes for therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {Foraging experience is correlated with structural plasticity of the mushroom bodies of the honey bee brain. While several neurotransmitter and intracellular signaling pathways have been previously implicated as mediators of these structural changes, none interact directly with the cytoskeleton, the ultimate effector of changes in neuronal morphology. The Rho family of GTPases are small, monomeric G proteins that, when activated, initiate a signaling cascade that reorganizes the neuronal cytoskeleton. In this study, we measured activity of two members of the Rho family of GTPases, Rac and RhoA, in the mushroom bodies of bees with different durations of foraging experience. A transient increase in Rac activity coupled with a transient decrease in RhoA activity was found in honey bees with 4 days foraging experience compared with same-aged new foragers. These observations are in accord with previous reports based on studies of other species of a growth supporting role for Rac and a growth opposing role for RhoA. This is the first report of Rho GTPase activation in the honey bee brain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {GeMMA (Genome Modelling and Model Annotation) is a new approach to automatic functional subfamily classification within families and superfamilies of protein sequences. A major advantage of GeMMA is its ability to subclassify very large and diverse superfamilies with tens of thousands of members, without the need for an initial multiple sequence alignment. Its performance is shown to be comparable to the established high-performance method SCI-PHY. GeMMA follows an agglomerative clustering protocol that uses existing software for sensitive and accurate multiple sequence alignment and profile-profile comparison. The produced subfamilies are shown to be equivalent in quality whether whole protein sequences are used or just the sequences of component predicted structural domains. A faster, heuristic version of GeMMA that also uses distributed computing is shown to maintain the performance levels of the original implementation. The use of GeMMA to increase the functional annotation coverage of functionally diverse Pfam families is demonstrated. It is further shown how GeMMA clusters can help to predict the impact of experimentally determining a protein domain structure on comparative protein modelling coverage, in the context of structural genomics. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2009.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion are mediated by membrane proteins. Unfortunately, as these proteins are not water soluble, it is extremely hard to experimentally determine their structure. Therefore, improved methods for predicting the structure of these proteins are vital in biological research. In order to improve transmembrane topology prediction, we evaluate the combined use of both integrated signal peptide prediction and evolutionary information in a single algorithm. RESULTS: A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. The method is found to predict both the correct topology and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80{\%} of the test set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72{\%} for other popular methods on the same benchmark. By using a second neural network specifically to discriminate transmembrane from globular proteins, a very low overall false positive rate (0.5{\%}) can also be achieved in detecting transmembrane proteins. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the described method is available both as a web server (http://www.psipred.net) and as downloadable source code from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/memsat. Both the server and source code files are free to non-commercial users. Benchmark and training data are also available from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/memsat.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is a key feature of transcriptome expansion in eukaryotic cells, yet its regulation is poorly understood. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for developmental regulation of splicing outcome through heritable epigenetic marks.},

abstract = {Cardiolipin (CL), a major phospholipid in bacterial cell walls, is sequestered from the immune system in mammalian mitochondria and is, therefore, a potential danger signal. Based on growing evidence that phospholipids constitute natural ligands for CD1 and that CD1d-restricted T cells recognize phospholipids, we hypothesized that CD1d binds and presents CL and that T cells in the normal immune repertoire respond to CL in a CD1d-restricted manner. We determined the murine CD1d-CL crystal structure at 2.3 {\AA} resolution and established through additional lipid loading experiments that CL, a tetra-acylated phospholipid, binds to murine CD1d with two alkyl chains buried inside the CD1d binding groove and the remaining two exposed into the solvent. We furthermore demonstrate the functional stimulatory activity of CL, showing that splenic and hepatic $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells from healthy mice proliferate in vitro in response to mammalian or bacterial CL in a dose-dependent and CD1d-restricted manner, rapidly secreting the cytokines IFN-$\gamma$ and RANTES. Finally, we show that hepatic $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are activated in vivo by CD1d-bearing dendritic cells that have been pulsed with CL, but not phosphatidylcholine. Together, these findings demonstrate that CD1d is able to bind and present CL to a subset of CL-responsive $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells that exist in the spleen and liver of healthy mice and suggest that these cells could play a role in host responses to bacterial lipids and, potentially, self-CL. We propose that CL-responsive $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells play a role in immune surveillance during infection and tissue injury.},

abstract = {Motivation: Understanding functions of proteins in specific human tissues is essential for insights into disease diagnostics and therapeutics, yet prediction of tissue-specific cellular function remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. Results: Here, we present OhmNet, a hierarchy-aware unsupervised node feature learning approach for multi-layer networks. We build a multi-layer network, where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue. OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes, to a neural embedding-based low-dimensional space of features. OhmNet encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues, by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi-layer protein interaction network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue-specific cellular functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions of cellular function than alternative approaches, and also generates more accurate hypotheses about tissue-specific protein actions. We show that taking into account the tissue hierarchy leads to improved predictive power. Remarkably, we also demonstrate that it is possible to leverage the tissue hierarchy in order to effectively transfer cellular functions to a functionally uncharacterized tissue. Overall, OhmNet moves from flat networks to multiscale models able to predict a range of phenotypes spanning cellular subsystems.},

Central to evolving models are the high-resolution structures of individual ribosomal proteins, which represent detailed probes of their local RNA and protein environments. Ribosomal proteins are extremely ancient molecules; the structures therefore also provide a unique window into early protein evolution. Many of the proteins contain domains that are present in more recently evolved families of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins.

Representing, to our knowledge, the first structure of a CaCC, the eukaryotic BEST1 channel, which recapitulates CaCC function in liposomes, is formed from a pentameric assembly of subunits. Ca(2+) binds to the channel's large cytosolic region. A single ion pore, approximately 95 {\AA} in length, is located along the central axis and contains at least 15 binding sites for anions. A hydrophobic neck within the pore probably forms the gate. Phenylalanine residues within it may coordinate permeating anions via anion-$\pi$ interactions. Conformational changes observed near the 'Ca(2+) clasp' hint at the mechanism of Ca(2+)-dependent gating. Disease-causing mutations are prevalent within the gating apparatus.},

Under the hypothesis f=g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of nx ′ s and my ′ s is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m . Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n=m=8 . At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x){\textgreater}g(x) for every x .},

abstract = {Membrane proteins are crucial for many biological functions and have become attractive targets for pharmacological agents. About 10{\%}-30{\%} of all proteins contain membrane-spanning helices. Despite recent successes, high-resolution structures for membrane proteins remain exceptional. The gap between known sequences and known structures calls for finding solutions through bioinformatics. While many methods predict membrane helices, very few predict membrane strands. The good news is that most methods for helical membrane proteins are available and are more often right than wrong. The best current prediction methods appear to correctly predict all membrane helices for about 50{\%}-70{\%} of all proteins, and to falsely predict membrane helices for about 10{\%} of all globular proteins. The bad news is that developers have seriously overestimated the accuracy of their methods. In particular, while simple hydrophobicity scales identify many membrane helices, they frequently and incorrectly predict membrane helices in globular proteins. Additionally, all methods tend to confuse signal peptides with membrane helices. Nonetheless, wet-lab biologists can reach into an impressive toolbox for membrane protein predictions. However, the computational biologists will have to improve their methods considerably before they reach the levels of accuracy they claim.},

abstract = {Glucose-derived pyruvate is a principal source of acetyl-CoA in all brain cells, through pyruvate dehydogenase complex (PDHC) reaction. Cholinergic neurons like neurons of other transmitter systems and glial cells, utilize acetyl-CoA for energy production in mitochondria and diverse synthetic pathways in their extramitochondrial compartments. However, cholinergic neurons require additional amounts of acetyl-CoA for acetylcholine synthesis in their cytoplasmic compartment to maintain their transmitter functions. Characteristic feature of several neurodegenerating diseases including Alzheimer's disease and thiamine diphosphate deficiency encephalopathy is the decrease of PDHC activity correlating with cholinergic deficits and losses of cognitive functions. Such conditions generate acetyl-CoA deficits that are deeper in cholinergic neurons than in noncholinergic neuronal and glial cells, due to its additional consumption in the transmitter synthesis. Therefore, any neuropathologic conditions are likely to be more harmful for the cholinergic neurons than for noncholinergic ones. For this reason attempts preserving proper supply of acetyl-CoA in the diseased brain, should attenuate high susceptibility of cholinergic neurons to diverse neurodegenerative conditions. This review describes how common neurodegenerative signals could induce deficts in cholinergic neurotransmission through suppression of acetyl-CoA metabolism in the cholinergic neurons.},

abstract = {As the number of known proteins has expanded, how to accurately identify DNA binding proteins has become a significant biological challenge. At present, various computational methods have been proposed to recognize DNA-binding proteins from only amino acid sequences, such as SVM, DNABP and CNN-RNN. However, these methods do not consider the context in amino acid sequences, which makes it difficult for them to adequately capture sequence features. In this study, a new method that coordinates a bidirectional long-term memory recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network, called CNN-BiLSTM, is proposed to identify DNA binding proteins. The CNN-BiLSTM model can explore the potential contextual relationships of amino acid sequences and obtain more features than can traditional models. The experimental results show that the CNN-BiLSTM achieves a validation set prediction accuracy of 96.5{\%}—7.8{\%} higher than that of SVM, 9.6{\%} higher than that of DNABP and 3.7{\%} higher than that of CNN-RNN. After testing on 20,000 independent samples provided by UniProt that were not involved in model training, the accuracy of CNN-BiLSTM reached 94.5{\%}—12{\%} higher than that of SVM, 4.9{\%} higher than that of DNABP and 4{\%} higher than that of CNN-RNN. We visualized and compared the model training process of CNN-BiLSTM with that of CNN-RNN and found that the former is capable of better generalization from the training dataset, showing that CNN-BiLSTM has a wider range of adaptations to protein sequences. On the test set, CNN-BiLSTM has better credibility because its predicted scores are closer to the sample labels than are those of CNN-RNN. Therefore, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM is a more powerful method for identifying DNA-binding proteins.},

METHODS: Study key eligibility criteria: measurement of penis size by a health professional using a standard procedure; a minimum of 50 participants per sample Exclusion criteria were samples with a congenital or acquired penile abnormality. previous surgery, complaint of small penis size or erectile dysfunction Synthesis methods: Calculation of a weighted mean and pooled standard deviation and simulation of 20,000 observations from the normal distribution to generate nomograms of penis size.

RESULTS: Nomograms for flaccid pendulous (n = 10,704, mean 9.16cm, sd 1.57) and stretched length (n=14,160, mean 13.24cm, sd 1.89), erect length (n = 692, mean 13.12cm, sd 1.66), flaccid circumference (n = 9,407, mean 9.31cm, sd 0.90); and erect circumference (n = 381, mean 11.66cm, sd 1.10) were constructed. Consistent and strongest significant correlation was between flaccid stretched or erect length and height, which ranged from r = 0.2 to 0.6.

CONCLUSIONS: penis size nomograms may be useful in clinical and therapeutic settings to counsel men and for academic research. Limitations: a relatively small number of erect measurements were conducted in a clinical setting and the greatest variability between studies was with flaccid stretched length.},

abstract = {Amyloid oligomers are believed to play important causal roles in many types of amyloid-related degenerative diseases. Many different laboratories have reported amyloid oligomers that differ in size, morphology, toxicity, and method of preparation or purification, raising the question of the structural relationships among these oligomer preparations. The structural plasticity that has been reported to occur in amyloids formed from the same protein sequence indicates that it is quite possible that different oligomer preparations may represent distinct structural variants. In view of the difficulty in determining the precise structure of amyloids, conformation- and epitope-specific antibodies may provide a facile means of classifying amyloid oligomer structures. Conformation-dependent antibodies that recognize generic epitopes that are specifically associated with distinct aggregation states of many different amyloid-forming sequences indicate that there are at least two fundamentally distinct types of amyloid oligomers: fibrillar and prefibrillar oligomers. Classification of amyloid oligomers according to their underlying structures may be a more useful and rational approach than relying on differences in size and morphology.},

abstract = {Exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are cis-regulatory elements that inhibit the use of adjacent splice sites, often contributing to alternative splicing (AS). To systematically identify ESSs, an in vivo splicing reporter system was developed to screen a library of random decanucleotides. The screen yielded 141 ESS decamers, 133 of which were unique. The silencer activity of over a dozen of these sequences was also confirmed in a heterologous exon/intron context and in a second cell type. Of the unique ESS decamers, most could be clustered into groups to yield seven putative ESS motifs, some resembling known motifs bound by hnRNPs H and A1. Potential roles of ESSs in constitutive splicing were explored using an algorithm, ExonScan, which simulates splicing based on known or putative splicing-related motifs. ExonScan and related bioinformatic analyses suggest that these ESS motifs play important roles in suppression of pseudoexons, in splice site definition, and in AS.},

abstract = {Thousands of mutations are identified yearly. Although many directly affect protein expression, an increasing proportion of mutations is now believed to influence mRNA splicing. They mostly affect existing splice sites, but synonymous, non-synonymous or nonsense mutations can also create or disrupt splice sites or auxiliary cis-splicing sequences. To facilitate the analysis of the different mutations, we designed Human Splicing Finder (HSF), a tool to predict the effects of mutations on splicing signals or to identify splicing motifs in any human sequence. It contains all available matrices for auxiliary sequence prediction as well as new ones for binding sites of the 9G8 and Tra2-beta Serine-Arginine proteins and the hnRNP A1 ribonucleoprotein. We also developed new Position Weight Matrices to assess the strength of 5' and 3' splice sites and branch points. We evaluated HSF efficiency using a set of 83 intronic and 35 exonic mutations known to result in splicing defects. We showed that the mutation effect was correctly predicted in almost all cases. HSF could thus represent a valuable resource for research, diagnostic and therapeutic (e.g. therapeutic exon skipping) purposes as well as for global studies, such as the GEN2PHEN European Project or the Human Variome Project.},

abstract = {Extracellular amyloid beta peptides (Abetas) have long been thought to be a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Now, detection of intracellular neuronal Abeta1--42 accumulation before extracellular Abeta deposits questions the relevance of intracellular peptides in AD. In the present study, we directly address whether intracellular Abeta is toxic to human neurons. Microinjections of Abeta1--42 peptide or a cDNA-expressing cytosolic Abeta1--42 rapidly induces cell death of primary human neurons. In contrast, Abeta1--40, Abeta40--1, or Abeta42--1 peptides, and cDNAs expressing cytosolic Abeta1--40 or secreted Abeta1--42 and Abeta1--40, are not toxic. As little as a 1-pM concentration or 1500 molecules/cell of Abeta1--42 peptides is neurotoxic. The nonfibrillized and fibrillized Abeta1--42 peptides are equally toxic. In contrast, Abeta1--42 peptides are not toxic to human primary astrocytes, neuronal, and nonneuronal cell lines. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis protects against Abeta1--42 toxicity, indicating that programmed cell death is involved. Bcl-2, Bax-neutralizing antibodies, cDNA expression of a p53R273H dominant negative mutant, and caspase inhibitors prevent Abeta1--42-mediated human neuronal cell death. Taken together, our data directly demonstrate that intracellular Abeta1--42 is selectively cytotoxic to human neurons through the p53--Bax cell death pathway.},

Lipid-rich environments settled by a variety of organisms exert strong evolutionary pressure for establishing enzymatic pathways involved in lipid metabolism. However, a certain number of enzymes involved in this process remain unknown since they do not share detectable sequence similarity with any known protein domains. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition we predict that bacterial transmembrane proteins belonging to the uncharacterized domain of unknown function 2319 (DUF2319) family possess the alpha/beta hydrolase fold domain together with the catalytic triad critical for hydrolysis. A detailed analysis of sequence/structure features and genomic context indicates that DUF2319 proteins may be involved in lipid metabolism.

Our model shows how eukaryote-specific elements considerably expand the network of interactions within the ribosome and provides insights into eukaryote-specific features of protein synthesis. Our crystals capture the ribosome in the ratcheted state, which is essential for translocation of mRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA), and in which the small ribosomal subunit has rotated with respect to the large subunit. We describe the conformational changes in both ribosomal subunits that are involved in ratcheting and their implications in coordination between the two associated subunits and in mRNA and tRNA translocation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have profiled multidimensional genomic data, including mutation and expression profiles on a variety of cancer cell types, to uncover the molecular mechanism of cancerogenesis. More than a hundred driver mutations have been characterized that confer the advantage of cell growth. However, how driver mutations regulate the transcriptome to affect cellular functions remains largely unexplored. Differential analysis of gene expression relative to a driver mutation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in understanding driver mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and developing personalized treatment strategies.

RESULTS: Here, we introduce the Snowball approach as a highly sensitive statistical analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures that are affected by a recurrent driver mutation. Snowball utilizes a resampling-based approach and combines a distance-based regression framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation, and further selects the top significant genes for downstream data analyses or experiments. In our application of the Snowball approach to both synthesized and TCGA data, we demonstrated that it outperforms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver mutations. Availability and implementation: R package and source code are available from CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DESnowball, and also available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/DESnowball/.

abstract = {The central dogma of biology, until not long ago, held that genetic information stored on DNA molecules was translated into the final protein products through RNA as intermediate molecules. Then, an additional level of complexity in the regulation of genome expression was added, implicating new classes of RNA molecules called non-coding RNA (ncRNA). These ncRNA are also often referred to as functional RNA in that, although they do not contain the capacity to encode proteins, do have a function as RNA molecules. They have been thus far considered as truly non-coding RNA since no ORF long enough to be considered, nor protein, have been associated with them. However, the recent identification and characterization of bifunctional RNA, i.e. RNA for which both coding capacity and activity as functional RNA have been reported, suggests that a definite categorization of some RNA molecules is far from being straightforward. Indeed, several RNA primarily classified as non-protein-coding RNA has been showed to hold coding capacities and associated peptides. Conversely, mRNA, usually regarded as strictly protein-coding, may act as functional RNA molecules. Here, we describe several examples of these bifunctional RNA that have been already characterized from bacteria to mammals. We also extend this concept to fortuitous acquisition of dual function in pathological conditions and to the recently highlighted duality between information carried by a gene and its pseudogenes counterparts.},

abstract = {Bacteriocins are selective protein antibiotics that bind and kill specific bacterial species, the best studied of which are the colicins that target Escherichia coli. Colicins tend to parasitize cell envelope systems that are important for cell viability under nutrient-limited conditions or environmental stress. In this chapter, we review how in conjunction with other biophysical methods and structural information, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been used to investigate how colicins enter E. coli cells. In particular, we summarize current understanding of the thermodynamics of outer membrane receptor binding and how this has been linked to biological function. We also summarize thermodynamic investigations using ITC that have helped elucidate the mechanisms by which colicins bind and parasitize proteins in the periplasm, forming protein-protein interactions that ultimately trigger translocation across the outer membrane. Our review focuses on the two major cytotoxic classes of colicin that have been the subject of intense investigation, pore-forming toxins, and nonspecific endonucleases (DNases). DNase colicin-producing E. coli avoid committing suicide through the production of a small antidote protein known as the immunity (Im) protein, with the Im protein only released once cell-entry is initiated. Exosite binding by Im proteins has driven an evolutionary arms race among colicin-producing bacteria whereby markedly different colicin DNase-Im protein interaction specificities have evolved without impacting on cytotoxicity. Extensive investigations have shown that homologous colicin DNase-Im protein complexes have K(d)s, for cognate and noncognate complexes, that vary by 10-orders of magnitude, essentially matching the entire spectrum of binding affinities seen for protein-protein interactions in biology. Hence, this system has proved to be a powerful model for investigating the thermodynamics of specificity in protein-protein interactions, with ITC being the principal tool. We review this literature and point to how the thermodynamic information that has been generated complements various other kinetic and structural data.},

abstract = {The recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins is thought to depend on two types of mechanism: one that involves the formation of hydrogen bonds with specific bases, primarily in the major groove, and one involving sequence-dependent deformations of the DNA helix. By comprehensively analysing the three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes, here we show that the binding of arginine residues to narrow minor grooves is a widely used mode for protein-DNA recognition. This readout mechanism exploits the phenomenon that narrow minor grooves strongly enhance the negative electrostatic potential of the DNA. The nucleosome core particle offers a prominent example of this effect. Minor-groove narrowing is often associated with the presence of A-tracts, AT-rich sequences that exclude the flexible TpA step. These findings indicate that the ability to detect local variations in DNA shape and electrostatic potential is a general mechanism that enables proteins to use information in the minor groove, which otherwise offers few opportunities for the formation of base-specific hydrogen bonds, to achieve DNA-binding specificity.},

Individuals bearing inactivating mutations in components of this response exhibit clinical symptoms that include cellular radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. The archetype for such disorders is Ataxia-Telangiectasia caused by biallelic mutation in ATM, a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is mutated in the RIDDLE syndrome, a recently discovered immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity disorder. We show that RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by binding to ubiquitylated histone H2A. RNF168 acts with UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitylation by targeting H2A-type histones and by promoting the formation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates. These RNF168-dependent chromatin modifications orchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA lesions, and their loss is the likely cause of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with RIDDLE syndrome.},

abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been shown to induce potent mitogenic responses in various cell types, yet its sustained local delivery is still an underdeveloped domain in the clinic. We report here an engineered IGF-1 that facilitates extended local delivery to a site through its immobilization capacity within fibrin. Through recombinant fusion with a substrate sequence tag derived from $\alpha$(2)-plasmin inhibitor ($\alpha$(2)PI(1-8)), the resulting variant, $\alpha$(2)PI(1-8)-IGF-1, was covalently incorporated into fibrin matrices during normal thrombin/factor XIIIa-mediated polymerization. Bioactivity of the variant was confirmed to be equivalent to wild type (WT) IGF-1 via IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation studies in urinary tract-derived cells in 2-D. Assessment of functional retention within 3-D fibrin matrices demonstrated that incorporation of $\alpha$(2)PI(1-8)-IGF-1 induced a 1.3- and 1.5-fold more robust proliferative response in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) than WT IGF-1 and negative control matrices, respectively, when release was not contained. Sustained $\alpha$(2)PI(1-8)-IGF-1 availability at bladder lesion sites in vivo evoked a considerable increase in SMC proliferation and a favorable host tissue response after 28 days in rats. We conclude that the sustained local IGF-1 availability from fibrin provided by our variant protein enhances smooth muscle regeneration better than the WT form of the protein.},

abstract = {Over the past four or five decades, there has been increasing interest in the neurochemical regulation of cognition. This field received considerable attention in the 1980s, with the identification of possible cognition enhancing agents or "smart drugs". Even though many of the optimistic claims for some agents have proven premature, evidence suggests that several metabolic agents may prove to be effective in improving and preserving cognitive performance and may lead to better cognitive aging through the lifespan. Aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration in physiological functions and metabolic processes. There are a number of agents with the potential to improve metabolic activity. Research is now beginning to identify these various agents and delineate their potential usefulness for improving cognition in health and disease. This review provides a brief overview of the metabolic agents glucose, oxygen, pyruvate, creatine, and L-carnitine and their beneficial effects on cognitive function. These agents are directly responsible for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) the main cellular currency of energy. The brain is the most metabolically active organ in the body and as such is particularly vulnerable to disruption of energy resources. Therefore interventions that sustain adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels may have importance for improving neuronal dysfunction and loss. Moreover, recently, it has been observed that environmental conditions and diet can affect transgenerational gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Metabolic agents might play a role in regulation of nutritional epigenetic effects. In summary, the reviewed metabolic agents represent a promising strategy for improving cognitive function and possibly slowing or preventing cognitive decline. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In the standard reference of bacterial phylogeny based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequence comparison, M. tuberculosis belongs to the high G+C Gram-positive bacteria that form a monophyletic group with the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis. Some analyses indicate no particular relationship between these two groups. The availability of the complete genome sequence of M. tuberculosis allows us to reexamine this issue from genomic perspectives, as genome-based phylogenies may be more representative of the evolutionary history of whole organisms than molecular trees. In the genome tree constructed based on conserved gene content, M. tuberculosis is more related to Gram-negative than to Gram-positive bacteria as reflected by the evolutionary distance between nearest ancestral units. This conclusion may be supported by another analysis showing that M. tuberculosis shares relatively more orthologous genes for energy production and conversion with Gram-negative bacteria, in particular, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, than with Gram-positive bacteria.},

abstract = {We show that a natural behavior, exploration of a novel environment, causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons of young adult wild-type mice. DSBs occurred in multiple brain regions, were most abundant in the dentate gyrus, which is involved in learning and memory, and were repaired within 24 h. Increasing neuronal activity by sensory or optogenetic stimulation increased neuronal DSBs in relevant but not irrelevant networks. Mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), which simulate key aspects of Alzheimer's disease, had increased neuronal DSBs at baseline and more severe and prolonged DSBs after exploration. Interventions that suppress aberrant neuronal activity and improve learning and memory in hAPP mice normalized their levels of DSBs. Blocking extrasynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors prevented amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-induced DSBs in neuronal cultures. Thus, transient increases in neuronal DSBs occur as a result of physiological brain activity, and A$\beta$ exacerbates DNA damage, most likely by eliciting synaptic dysfunction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {The Tol system is a five-protein assembly parasitized by colicins and bacteriophages that helps stabilize the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM). We show that allosteric signalling through the six-bladed beta-propeller protein TolB is central to Tol function in Escherichia coli and that this is subverted by colicins such as ColE9 to initiate their OM translocation. Protein-protein interactions with the TolB beta-propeller govern two conformational states that are adopted by the distal N-terminal 12 residues of TolB that bind TolA in the inner membrane. ColE9 promotes disorder of this 'TolA box' and recruitment of TolA. In contrast to ColE9, binding of the OM lipoprotein Pal to the same site induces conformational changes that sequester the TolA box to the TolB surface in which it exhibits little or no TolA binding. Our data suggest that Pal is an OFF switch for the Tol assembly, whereas colicins promote an ON state even though mimicking Pal. Comparison of the TolB mechanism to that of vertebrate guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 suggests that allosteric signalling may be more prevalent in beta-propeller proteins than currently realized.},

abstract = {Gene therapy has the potential to provide cancer treatments based on novel mechanisms of action with potentially low toxicities. This therapy may provide more effective control of locoregional recurrence in diseases like non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as systemic control of micrometastases. Despite current limitations, retroviral and adenoviral vectors can, in certain circumstances, provide an effective means of delivering therapeutic genes to tumor cells. Although multiple genes are involved in carcinogenesis, mutations of the p53 gene are the most frequent abnormality identified in human tumors. Preclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo have shown that restoring p53 function can induce apoptosis in cancer cells. High levels of p53 expression and DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin (Platinol) and ionizing radiation work synergistically to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Phase I clinical trials now show that p53 gene replacement therapy using both retroviral and adenoviral vectors is feasible and safe. In addition, p53 gene replacement therapy induces tumor regression in patients with advanced NSCLC and in those with recurrent head and neck cancer. This article describes various gene therapy strategies under investigation, reviews preclinical data that provide a rationale for the gene replacement approach, and discusses the clinical trial data available to date.},

abstract = {The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a ligand-regulated membrane protein chaperone involved in the ER stress response. S1R activity is implicated in diseases of the central nervous system including amnesia, schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer disease, and addiction. S1R has been shown previously to regulate the Hsp70 binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and the inositol triphosphate receptor calcium channel through a C-terminal domain. We have developed methods for bacterial expression and reconstitution of the chaperone domain of human S1R into detergent micelles that enable its study by solution NMR spectroscopy. The chaperone domain is found to contain a helix at the N terminus followed by a largely dynamic region and a structured, helical C-terminal region that encompasses a membrane associated domain containing four helices. The helical region at residues ∼198-206 is strongly amphipathic and proposed to anchor the chaperone domain to micelles and membranes. Three of the helices in the C-terminal region closely correspond to previously identified cholesterol and drug recognition sites. In addition, it is shown that the chaperone domain interacts with full-length BiP or the isolated nucleotide binding domain of BiP, but not the substrate binding domain, suggesting that the nucleotide binding domain is sufficient for S1R interactions.},

Here we show that for random networks the ranking provided by pagerank is sensitive to perturbations in the network topology, making it unreliable for incomplete or noisy systems. In contrast, in scale-free networks we predict analytically the emergence of super-stable nodes whose ranking is exceptionally stable to perturbations. We calculate the dependence of the number of super-stable nodes on network characteristics and demonstrate their presence in real networks, in agreement with the analytical predictions. These results not only deepen our understanding of the interplay between network topology and dynamical processes but also have implications in all areas where ranking has a role, from science to marketing.},

Although all of these pathways modulate transcription from chromatin in vivo, the mechanisms by which epigenetic information is transmitted through cell division remain unclear.

However, because of its dynamic organization and complex regulation it is difficult to obtain a complete description of its molecular composition. We have implemented an integrated computational approach to characterize novel human spindle components and have analysed in detail the individual candidates predicted to be spindle proteins, as well as the network of predicted relations connecting known and putative spindle proteins. The subsequent experimental validation of a number of predicted novel proteins confirmed not only their association with the spindle apparatus but also their role in mitosis. We found that 75{\%} of our tested proteins are localizing to the spindle apparatus compared to a success rate of 35{\%} when expert knowledge alone was used. We compare our results to the previously published MitoCheck study and see that our approach does validate some findings by this consortium. Further, we predict so-called "hidden spindle hub", proteins whose network of interactions is still poorly characterised by experimental means and which are thought to influence the functionality of the mitotic spindle on a large scale. Our analyses suggest that we are still far from knowing the complete repertoire of functionally important components of the human spindle network. Combining integrated bio-computational approaches and single gene experimental follow-ups could be key to exploring the still hidden regions of the human spindle system.},

abstract = {A novel database search algorithm is presented for the qualitative identification of proteins over a wide dynamic range, both in simple and complex biological samples. The algorithm has been designed for the analysis of data originating from data independent acquisitions, whereby multiple precursor ions are fragmented simultaneously. Measurements used by the algorithm include retention time, ion intensities, charge state, and accurate masses on both precursor and product ions from LC-MS data. The search algorithm uses an iterative process whereby each iteration incrementally increases the selectivity, specificity, and sensitivity of the overall strategy. Increased specificity is obtained by utilizing a subset database search approach, whereby for each subsequent stage of the search, only those peptides from securely identified proteins are queried. Tentative peptide and protein identifications are ranked and scored by their relative correlation to a number of models of known and empirically derived physicochemical attributes of proteins and peptides. In addition, the algorithm utilizes decoy database techniques for automatically determining the false positive identification rates. The search algorithm has been tested by comparing the search results from a four-protein mixture, the same four-protein mixture spiked into a complex biological background, and a variety of other "system" type protein digest mixtures. The method was validated independently by data dependent methods, while concurrently relying on replication and selectivity. Comparisons were also performed with other commercially and publicly available peptide fragmentation search algorithms. The presented results demonstrate the ability to correctly identify peptides and proteins from data independent acquisition strategies with high sensitivity and specificity. They also illustrate a more comprehensive analysis of the samples studied; providing approximately 20{\%} more protein identifications, compared to a more conventional data directed approach using the same identification criteria, with a concurrent increase in both sequence coverage and the number of modified peptides. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The biogenesis of this multi-subunit enzyme is a sophisticated multi-step process that is regulated on levels of transcription, translation and assembly. Defects that result in diminished abundance or functional impairment of the F1F(O)-ATP synthase can cause a variety of severe neuromuscular disorders. Underlying mutations have been identified in both the nuclear and the mitochondrial DNA. The pathogenic mechanisms are only partially understood. Currently, the therapeutic options are extremely limited. Alternative methods of treatment have however been proposed, but still encounter several technical difficulties. The application of novel scientific approaches promises to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the ATP synthase, unravel novel therapeutic pathways and improve the unfortunate situation of the patients suffering from such diseases.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli secrete bacteriocins into the culture medium is unique and quite different from the mechanism by which other proteins are translocated across the two bacterial membranes, namely through the known branches of the general secretory pathway. The release of bacteriocins requires the expression and activity of a so-called bacteriocin release protein and the presence of the detergent-resistant phospholipase A in the outer membrane. The bacteriocin release proteins are highly expressed small lipoproteins which are synthesized with a signal peptide that remains stable and which accumulates in the cytoplasmic membrane after cleavage. The combined action of these stable, accumulated signal peptides, the lipid-modified mature bacteriocin release proteins (BRPs) and phospholipase A cause the release of bacteriocins. The structure and mode of action of these BRPs as well as their application in the release of heterologous proteins by E. coli is described in this review.},

abstract = {Age is the major risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), for reasons that are not clear. The association could indicate that the duration or degree of exposure to toxic proteins is important for pathology, or that age itself increases susceptibility to protein toxicity. Using an inducible Drosophila model of AD, we investigated these possibilities by varying the expression of an A$\beta$42 transgene in neurons at different adult ages and measuring the effects on A$\beta$42 levels and associated pathological phenotypes. Acute induction of Arctic A$\beta$42 in young adult flies resulted in rapid expression and clearance of mRNA and soluble Arctic A$\beta$42 protein, but in irreversible expression of insoluble Arctic A$\beta$42 peptide. Arctic A$\beta$42 peptide levels accumulated with longer durations of induction, and this led to a dose-dependent reduction in negative geotaxis and lifespan. For a standardised level of mRNA expression, older flies had higher levels of Arctic A$\beta$42 peptide and associated toxicity, and this correlated with an age-dependent reduction in proteasome activity. Equalising A$\beta$42 protein at different ages shortened lifespan in correlation with the duration of exposure to the peptide, suggesting that A$\beta$42 expression accumulates damage over time. However, the relative reduction in lifespan compared to controls was greater in flies first exposed to the peptide at older ages, suggesting that ageing itself also increases susceptibility to A$\beta$42 toxicity. Indeed older flies were more vulnerable to chronic A$\beta$42 toxicity even with a much lower lifetime exposure to the peptide. Finally, the persistence of insoluble A$\beta$42 in both young and old induced flies suggests that aggregated forms of the peptide cause toxicity in later life. Our results suggest that reduced protein turnover, increased duration of exposure and increased vulnerability to protein toxicity at later ages in combination could explain the late age-of-onset of neurodegenerative phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Rogers et al.},

abstract = {The functions of the liver and the pancreas differ; however, chronic inflammation in both organs is associated with fibrosis. Evidence suggests that fibrosis in both organs is partially regulated by organ-specific stellate cells. We explore the proteome of human hepatic stellate cells (hHSC) and human pancreatic stellate cells (hPaSC) using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics to investigate pathophysiologic mechanisms. Proteins were isolated from whole cell lysates of immortalized hHSC and hPaSC. These proteins were tryptically digested, labeled with tandem mass tags (TMT), fractionated by OFFGEL, and subjected to MS. Proteins significantly different in abundance (P{\textless}0.05) were classified via gene ontology (GO) analysis. We identified 1223 proteins and among them, 1222 proteins were quantifiable. Statistical analysis determined that 177 proteins were of higher abundance in hHSC, while 157 were of higher abundance in hPaSC. GO classification revealed that proteins of relatively higher abundance in hHSC were associated with protein production, while those of relatively higher abundance in hPaSC were involved in cell structure. Future studies using the methodologies established herein, but with further upstream fractionation and/or use of enhanced MS instrumentation will allow greater proteome coverage, achieving a comprehensive proteomic analysis of hHSC and hPaSC.},

abstract = {A detailed study and comparison was made on the catalytic activities of cutinases from Humilica insolens (HiC), Pseudomonas mendocina (PmC), and Fusarium solani (FsC) using low-crystallinity (lc) and biaxially oriented (bo) poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films as model substrates. Cutinase activity for PET hydrolysis was assayed using a pH-stat to measure NaOH consumption versus time, where initial activity was expressed as units of micromoles of NaOH added per hour and per milliliter of reaction volume. HiC was found to have good thermostability with maximum initial activity from 70 to 80 °C, whereas PmC and FsC performed best at 50 °C. Assays by pH-stat showed that the cutinases had about 10-fold higher activity for the lcPET (7{\%} crystallinity) than for the boPET (35{\%} crystallinity). Under optimal reaction conditions, initial activities of cutinases were successfully fit by a heterogeneous kinetic model. The hydrolysis rate constant k 2 was 7-fold higher for HiC at 70 °C (0.62 $\mu$mol/cm2/h) relative to PmC and FsC at 50 and 40 °C, respectively. With respect to PET affinity, PmC had the highest affinity, while FsC had the lowest value. In a 96 h degradation study using lcPET films, incubation with PmC and FsC both resulted in a 5{\%} film weight loss at 50 and 40 °C, respectively. In contrast, HiC-catalyzed lcPET film hydrolysis at 70 °C resulted in a 97 ± 3{\%} weight loss in 96 h, corresponding to a loss in film thickness of 30 $\mu$ per day. As degradation of lcPET progressed, crystallinity of the remaining film increased to 27{\%} due to preferential degradation of amorphous regions. Furthermore, for all three cutinases, analysis of aqueous soluble degradation products showed that they consist exclusively of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

A beta mainly consists of 40- and 42-mer peptides (Abeta 1-40 and A beta 1-42), which accumulate in senile plaques of AD brains and show neurotoxicity for cultured nerve cells. We synthesized all variant forms of A beta 1-42 associated with reported FAD, such as A21G (Flemish), E22Q (Dutch), E22K (Italian), E22G (Arctic), and D23N (Iowa) along with three potential mutants by one point missense mutation (E22A, E22D, and E22V) in a highly pure form, and examined their ability to aggregate and their neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. The mutants at positions 22 and 23 showed potent aggregative ability and neurotoxicity whereas the potential mutants did not, indicating that A beta 1-42 mutants at positions 22 and 23 play a critical role in FAD of Dutch-, Italian-, Arctic-, and Iowa-types. However, Flemish-type FAD needs alternative explanation except the aggregation and neurotoxicity of the corresponding A beta 1-42 mutant.},

CTD modifications orchestrate the interplay between transcription and processing of mRNA.

The structure reveals the intracellular gate in an open state, as opposed to the closed form reported previously, making NaK the only channel for which the three-dimensional structures of both conformations are known. Channel opening follows a conserved mechanism of inner helix bending using a flexible glycine residue, the gating hinge, seen in MthK and most other tetrameric cation channels. Additionally, distinct inter and intrasubunit rearrangements involved in channel gating are seen and characterized for the first time along with inner helix twisting motions. Furthermore, we identify a residue deeper within the cavity of the channel pore, Phe92, which is likely to form a constriction point within the open pore, restricting ion flux through the channel. Mutating this residue to alanine causes a subsequent increase in ion-conduction rates as measured by (86)Rb flux assays. The structures of both the open and closed conformations of the NaK channel correlate well with those of equivalent K(+) channel conformations, namely MthK and KcsA, respectively.},

abstract = {Phenomics is an emerging transdiscipline dedicated to the systematic study of phenotypes on a genome-wide scale. New methods for high-throughput genotyping have changed the priority for biomedical research to phenotyping, but the human phenome is vast and its dimensionality remains unknown. Phenomics research strategies capable of linking genetic variation to public health concerns need to prioritize development of mechanistic frameworks that relate neural systems functioning to human behavior. New approaches to phenotype definition will benefit from crossing neuropsychiatric syndromal boundaries, and defining phenotypic features across multiple levels of expression from proteome to syndrome. The demand for high throughput phenotyping may stimulate a migration from conventional laboratory to web-based assessment of behavior, and this offers the promise of . dynamic phenotyping-the iterative refinement of phenotype assays based on prior genotype-phenotype associations. Phenotypes that can be studied across species may provide greatest traction, particularly given rapid development in transgenic modeling. Phenomics research demands vertically integrated research teams, novel analytic strategies and informatics infrastructure to help manage complexity. The Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics at UCLA has been supported by the National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative to illustrate these principles, and is developing applications that may help investigators assemble, visualize, and ultimately test multi-level phenomics hypotheses. As the transdiscipline of phenomics matures, and work is extended to large-scale international collaborations, there is promise that systematic new knowledge bases will help fulfill the promise of personalized medicine and the rational diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes. {\textcopyright} 2009 IBRO.},

abstract = {To accurately determine the quantitative change of peptides and proteins in complex proteomics samples requires knowledge of how well each ion has been measured. The precision of each ions' calculated area is predicated on how uniquely it occupies its own space in m/z and elution time. Given an initial assumption that prior to the addition of the "heavy" label, all other ion detections are unique, which is arguably untrue, an initial attempt at quantifying the pervasiveness of ion interference events in a representative binary SILAC experiment was made by comparing the centered m/z and retention time of the ion detections from the "light" variant to its "heavy" companion. Ion interference rates were determined for LC-MS data acquired at mass resolving powers of 20 and 40 K with and without ion mobility separation activated. An ion interference event was recorded, if present in the companion dataset was an ion within ± its $\Delta$ mass at half-height, ±15 s of its apex retention time and if utilized by ±1 drift bin. Data are presented illustrating a definitive decrease in the frequency of ion interference events with each additional increase in selectivity of the analytical workflow. Regardless of whether the quantitative experiment is a composite of labeled samples or label free, how well each ion is measured can be determined given knowledge of the instruments mass resolving power across the entire m/z scale and the ion detection algorithm reporting both the centered m/z and $\Delta$ mass at half-height for each detected ion. Given these measurements, an effective resolution can be calculated and compared with the expected instrument performance value providing a purity score for the calculated ions' area based on mass resolution. Similarly, chromatographic and drift purity scores can be calculated. In these instances, the error associated to an ions' calculated peak area is estimated by examining the variation in each measured width to that of their respective experimental median. Detail will be disclosed as to how a final ion purity score was established, providing a first measure of how accurately each ions' area was determined as well as how precise the calculated quantitative change between labeled or unlabelled pairs were determined. Presented is how common ion interference events are in quantitative proteomics LC-MS experiments and how ion purity filters can be utilized to overcome and address them, providing ultimately more accurate and precise quantification results across a wider dynamic range. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The physical and chemical signals that are controlled by integrins are essential for intercellular communication and underpin all aspects of metazoan existence. To mediate such diverse functions, integrins exhibit structural diversity, flexibility and dynamism. Conformational changes, as opposed to surface expression or clustering, are central to the regulation of receptor function. In recent years, there has been intense interest in determining the three-dimensional structure of integrins, and analysing the shape changes that underpin the interconversion between functional states. Considering the central importance of the integrin signalling nexus, it is perhaps no surprise that obtaining this information has been difficult, and the answers gained so far have been complicated. In this Commentary, we pose some of the key remaining questions that surround integrin structure-function relationships and review the evidence that supports the current models.},

abstract = {Age-related dysfunction of the central auditory system, also known as central presbycusis, can affect speech perception and sound localization. Understanding the pathogenesis of central presbycusis will help to develop novel approaches to prevent or treat this disease. In this study, the mechanisms of central presbycusis were investigated using a mimetic aging rat model induced by chronic injection of D-galactose (D-Gal). We showed that malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were increased and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) activity was reduced in the auditory cortex in natural aging and D-Gal-induced mimetic aging rats. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 4834 bp deletion, abnormal ultrastructure and cell apoptosis in the auditory cortex were also found in natural aging and D-Gal mimetic aging rats. Sirt3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been shown to play a crucial role in controlling cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. However, the role of Sirt3 in the pathogenesis of age-related central auditory cortex deterioration is still unclear. Here, we showed that decreased Sirt3 expression might be associated with increased SOD2 acetylation, which negatively regulates SOD2 activity. Oxidative stress accumulation was likely the result of low SOD2 activity and a decline in ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that Sirt3 might play an essential role, via the mediation of SOD2, in central presbycusis and that manipulation of Sirt3 expression might provide a new approach to combat aging and oxidative stress-related diseases.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to provide an overview of the genetics of human ageing to gain novel insights about the mechanisms involved. By incorporating findings from model organisms to humans, such as mutations that either delay or accelerate ageing in mice, we constructed the gene networks previously related to ageing: namely, the network related to DNA metabolism and the network involving the GH/IGF-1 axis. Gathering data about the interacting partners of these proteins allowed us to suggest the involvement in ageing of a number of proteins through a "guilt-by-association" methodology. To organize our data, we developed the first curated database of genes related to human ageing: GenAge. With over 200 entries, GenAge may serve as a reference database of genes related to human ageing. Moreover, we rendered the first proteomic network map of human ageing, which suggests a relationship between the genetics of development and the genetics of ageing. Our work serves as a framework upon which a systems-biology understanding of ageing can be developed.

Recent developments in analytical procedures allow the high resolving power of sedimentation velocity methods to be coupled to sedimentation equilibrium approaches and applied to both static and dynamic associations. Improvements in global modeling based on numerical solutions of the Lamm equation have generated new sedimentation velocity applications with an emphasis on data interpretation using sedimentation coefficient or molar mass distributions. Procedures based on the use of multiple optical signals from absorption and interference optics for the analysis of the sedimentation velocity and equilibrium behavior of more complex interactions have now been developed. New applications of tracer sedimentation equilibrium experiments and the development of a fluorescence optical system for the analytical ultracentrifuge extend the accessible concentration range over several orders of magnitude and, coupled with the new analytical procedures, provide powerful new tools for studies of both weak and strong macromolecular interactions in solution. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit consists of multiple heptad repeats (consensus Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7), varying in number from 26 in yeast to 52 in vertebrates. The CTD functions to help couple transcription and processing of the nascent RNA and also plays roles in transcription elongation and termination. The CTD is subject to extensive post-translational modification, most notably phosphorylation, during the transcription cycle, which modulates its activities in the above processes. Therefore, understanding the nature of CTD modifications, including how they function and how they are regulated, is essential to understanding the mechanisms that control gene expression. While the significance of phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 residues has been studied and appreciated for some time, several additional modifications have more recently been added to the CTD repertoire, and insight into their function has begun to emerge. Here, we review findings regarding modification and function of the CTD, highlighting the important role this unique domain plays in coordinating gene activity.},

SVMs use two key concepts to solve this problem: large margin separation and kernel functions. The idea of large margin separation can be moti- vated by classification of points in two dimensions (see Figure 1). A simple way to classify the points is to draw a straight line and call points lying on one side positive and on the other side negative. If the two sets are well separated, one would intui- tively draw the separating line such that it is as far as possible away from the points in both sets (see Figures 2 and 3). This intuitive choice captures the idea of large margin separation, which is mathematically formulated in the section Classification with Large Margin.},

abstract = {Lithium is the prototype mood stabilizer but its mechanism is still unresolved. Two hypotheses dominate - the consequences of lithium's inhibition of inositol monophosphatase at therapeutically relevant concentrations (the 'inositol depletion' hypothesis), and of glycogen-synthase kinase-3. To further elaborate the inositol depletion hypothesis that did not decisively determine whether inositol depletion per se, or phosphoinositols accumulation induces the beneficial effects, we utilized knockout mice of either of two inositol metabolism-related genes - IMPA1 or SMIT1, both mimic several lithium's behavioral and biochemical effects. We assessed in vivo, under non-agonist-stimulated conditions, 3 H-inositol incorporation into brain phosphoinositols and phosphoinositides in wild-type, lithium-treated, IMPA1 and SMIT1 knockout mice. Lithium treatment increased frontal cortex and hippocampal phosphoinositols labeling by several fold, but decreased phosphoinositides labeling in the frontal cortex of the wild-type mice of the IMPA1 colony strain by ∼50{\%}. Inositol metabolites were differently affected by IMPA1 and SMIT1 knockout. Inositoltrisphosphate administered intracerebroventricularly affected bipolar-related behaviors and autophagy markers in a lithium-like manner. Namely, IP 3 but not IP 1 reduced the immobility time of wild-type mice in the forced swim test model of antidepressant action by 30{\%}, an effect that was reversed by an antagonist of all three IP 3 receptors; amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion of wild-type mice (distance traveled) was 35{\%} reduced by IP 3 administration; IP 3 administration increased hippocampal messenger RNA levels of Beclin-1 (required for autophagy execution) and hippocampal and frontal cortex protein levels ratio of Beclin-1/p62 by about threefold (p62 is degraded by autophagy). To conclude, lithium affects the phosphatidylinositol signaling system in two ways: depleting inositol, consequently decreasing phosphoinositides; elevating inositol monophosphate levels followed by phosphoinositols accumulation. Each or both may mediate lithium-induced behavior.},

To stabilize a closed conformation of GLIC, a bacterial proton-gated homolog from Gloeobacter violaceus whose open structure is known, we separately generated either four cross-links or two single mutations. We found all six mutants to be in the same 'locally closed' conformation using X-ray crystallography, sharing most of the features of the open form but showing a locally closed pore as a result of a concerted bending of all of its M2 helices. The mutants adopt several variant conformations of the M2-M3 loop, and in all cases an interacting lipid that is observed in the open form disappears. A single cross-linked mutant is functional, according to electrophysiology, and the locally closed structure of this mutant indicates that it has an increased flexibility. Further cross-linking, accessibility and molecular dynamics data suggest that the locally closed form is a functionally relevant conformation that occurs during allosteric gating transitions.},

This review aims to summarize published evidence that several longevity-promoting interventions may converge by causing an activation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption to promote increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These serve as molecular signals to exert downstream effects to ultimately induce endogenous defense mechanisms culminating in increased stress resistance and longevity, an adaptive response more specifically named mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis. Consistently, we here summarize findings that antioxidant supplements that prevent these ROS signals interfere with the health-promoting and life-span-extending capabilities of calorie restriction and physical exercise. Taken together and consistent with ample published evidence, the findings summarized here question Harman's Free Radical Theory of Aging and rather suggest that ROS act as essential signaling molecules to promote metabolic health and longevity.},

Results: FunSite's prediction performance was rigorously benchmarked using cross-validation and a holdout dataset. FunSite outperformed other publicly-available functional site prediction methods.

abstract = {In this article, interactions between Bacillus subtilis single-stranded DNA binding proteins (BsSSB) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were systematically studied. The effect of different molar ratios between BsSSB and ssDNA on their binding modes was first investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). It is found that a high molar ratio of BsSSB to ssDNA can produce BsSSB-ssDNA complexes formed in the mode of two proteins binding one 65-nt (nucleotide) ssDNA whereas a low molar ratio facilitates the formation of BsSSB-ssDNA complexes in the mode of one protein binding one 65-nt ssDNA. Furthermore, two binding modes are in dynamic equilibrium. The unbinding force of BsSSB-ssDNA complexes was measured quantitatively in solutions with different salt concentrations by using AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). Our results show that the unbinding force is about 10 pN higher at high salt concentration (0.5 M NaCl) than at low salt concentration (0.1 M NaCl) and the lifetime of BsSSB-ssDNA complexes at high salt concentration is twice as long as that at low salt concentration. These results indicate that more tightly packed BsSSB-ssDNA complexes can form at high salt (0.5 M NaCl) concentration. In addition, the results of EMSA show that ssDNA, which is bound to BsSSB, can dissociate from BsSSB in the presence of the cDNA strand, indicating the dynamic nature of BsSSB-ssDNA interactions.},

abstract = {PEGylation has turned proteins into important new biopharmaceuticals. The fundamental problems with the existing approaches to PEGylation are inefficient conjugation and the formation of heterogeneous mixts. This is because poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is usually conjugated to nucleophilic amine residues. The authors' PEGylation protocol solves these problems by exploiting the chem. reactivity of both of the sulfur atoms in the disulfide bond of many biol. relevant proteins. An accessible disulfide bond is mildly reduced to liberate the two cysteine sulfur atoms without disturbing the protein's tertiary structure. Site-specific PEGylation is achieved with a bis-thiol alkylating PEG reagent that sequentially undergoes conjugation to form a three-carbon bridge. The two sulfur atoms are re-linked with PEG selectively conjugated to the bridge. PEGylation of a protein can be completed in 24 h and purifn. of the PEG-protein conjugate in another 3 h. The authors have successfully applied this approach to PEGylation of cytokines, enzymes, antibody fragments and peptides, without destroying their tertiary structure or abolishing their biol. activity.

abstract = {CASP (critical assessment of structure prediction) assesses the state of the art in modeling protein structure from amino acid sequence. The most recent experiment (CASP13 held in 2018) saw dramatic progress in structure modeling without use of structural templates (historically “ab initio” modeling). Progress was driven by the successful application of deep learning techniques to predict inter-residue distances. In turn, these results drove dramatic improvements in three-dimensional structure accuracy: With the proviso that there are an adequate number of sequences known for the protein family, the new methods essentially solve the long-standing problem of predicting the fold topology of monomeric proteins. Further, the number of sequences required in the alignment has fallen substantially. There is also substantial improvement in the accuracy of template-based models. Other areas—model refinement, accuracy estimation, and the structure of protein assemblies—have again yielded interesting results. CASP13 placed increased emphasis on the use of sparse data together with modeling and chemical crosslinking, SAXS, and NMR all yielded more mature results. This paper summarizes the key outcomes of CASP13. The special issue of PROTEINS contains papers describing the CASP13 assessments in each modeling category and contributions from the participants.},

abstract = {Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.},

abstract = {This study aimed to identify candidate genes and explore the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exon microarray data composed by of three human entorhinal cortex samples of AD patients and three non-demented controls (NDC) were analyzed, then expression profile data were preprocessed with the Oligo package and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by limma package in R/Bioconductor. In addition, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was predicted and constructed using the STRING database. Finally, gene ontology (GO)-biological processes (BP) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched by DEGs were recognized. A total of 124 up-regulated and 218 down-regulated genes were identified. TGF-beta-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 (TAB 2) and chromogranin B (secretogranin 1) (CHGB) were the significantly up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. In addition, DEGs of DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1 (DNAJB1) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (HSPA1A) were in the up-regulated network, while synaptophysin (SYP) and somatostatin (SST) were in the down-regulated network. Furthermore, the up-regulated genes were enriched in GO-BP terms of protein stimulus, unfolding and organic substance, etc., and pathways of ECM–receptor interaction, etc. The down-regulated genes were mainly associated with nerve-related transmission and neuroactive substances transportation. Protein folding abnormality and altered synaptic transmission could have a synergistic effect on the pathomechanism of AD. DEGs including DNAJB1 and HSPA1A may be involved in both the processes, while CHGB, SYP and SST may be important for the regulation of synaptic transmission to contribute to the progress and development of AD.},

abstract = {Bilayer lipids contribute to the stability of membrane transporters and are crucially involved in their proper functioning. However, the molecular knowledge of how surrounding lipids affect membrane transport is surprisingly limited and despite its general importance is rarely considered in the molecular description of a transport mechanism. One reason is that only few atomic resolution structures of channels or transporters reveal a functional interaction with lipids, which are difficult to detect in X-ray structures per se. Overcoming these difficulties, we report here on a new structure of the osmotic stress-regulated betaine transporter BetP in complex with anionic lipids. This lipid-associated BetP structure is important in the molecular understanding of osmoregulation due to the strong dependence of activity regulation in BetP on the presence of negatively charged lipids. We detected eight resolved palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) lipids mimicking parts of the membrane leaflets and interacting with key residues in transport and regulation. The lipid-protein interactions observed here in structural detail in BetP provide molecular insights into the role of lipids in osmoregulated secondary transport.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

@article{Roth2009,
abstract = {The orthogonal axes of Drosophila are established during oogenesis through a hierarchical series of symmetry-breaking steps, most of which can be traced back to asymmetries inherent in the architecture of the ovary. Oogenesis begins with the formation of a germline cyst of 16 cells connected by ring canals. Two of these 16 cells have four ring canals, whereas the others have fewer. The first symmetry-breaking step is the selection of one of these two cells to become the oocyte. Subsequently, the germline cyst becomes surrounded by somatic follicle cells to generate individual egg chambers. The second symmetry-breaking step is the posterior positioning of the oocyte within the egg chamber, a process mediated by adhesive interactions with a special group of somatic cells. Posterior oocyte positioning is accompanied by a par gene-dependent repolarization of the microtubule network, which establishes the posterior cortex of the oocyte. The next two steps of symmetry breaking occur during midoogenesis after the volume of the oocyte has increased about 10-fold. First, a signal from the oocyte specifies posterior follicle cells, polarizing a symmetric prepattern present within the follicular epithelium. Second, the posterior follicle cells send a signal back to the oocyte, which leads to a second repolarization of the oocyte microtubule network and the asymmetric migration of the oocyte nucleus. This process again requires the par genes. The repolarization of the microtubule network results in the transport of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, the anterior and posterior determinants, respectively, of the embryonic axis, to opposite poles of the oocyte. The asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus defines a cortical region of the oocyte where gurken mRNA is localized, thus breaking the dorsal-ventral symmetry of the egg and embryo.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the extent to which starch synthesis in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers is controlled by the activity of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27; AGPase). In order to do this, fluxes of carbohydrate metabolism were measured in tubers that had reduced AGPase activity as a result of the expression of a cDNA encoding the B subunit in the antisense orientation. Reduction in AGPase activity led to a reduction in starch accumulation, and an increase in sucrose accumulation. The control coefficient of AGPase on starch accumulation in intact plants was estimated to be around 0.3. The fluxes of carbohydrate metabolism were measured in tuber discs from wild-type and transgenic plants by investigating the metabolism of [U-(14)C]glucose. In tuber discs, the control coefficient of AGPase over starch synthesis was estimated as 0.55, while the control coefficient of the enzyme over sucrose synthesis was -0.47. The values obtained suggest that AGPase activity exerts appreciable control over tuber metabolism in potato.},

Our results indicate that the sequences of splice sites are largely homogeneous within tetrapoda. We have also found that orthologous splice signals between human and rodents and within rodents are more conserved than unrelated splice sites, but the additional conservation can be explained mostly by background intron conservation. In contrast, additional conservation over background is detectable in orthologous mammalian and chicken splice sites. Our results also indicate that the U2 and U12 intron classes seem to have evolved independently since the split of mammals and birds; we have not been able to find a convincing case of interconversion between these two classes in our collections of orthologous introns. Similarly, we have not found a single case of switching between AT-AC and GT-AG subtypes within U12 introns, suggesting that this event has been a rare occurrence in recent evolutionary times. Switching between GT-AG and the noncanonical GC-AG U2 subtypes, on the contrary, does not appear to be unusual; in particular, T to C mutations appear to be relatively well tolerated in GT-AG introns with very strong donor sites.},

abstract = {Cellular import of colicin E3 is initiated by the Escherichia coli outer membrane cobalamin transporter, BtuB. The 135-residue 100-A coiled-coil receptor-binding domain (R135) of colicin E3 forms a 1:1 complex with BtuB whose structure at a resolution of 2.75 A is reported. Binding of R135 to the BtuB extracellular surface (DeltaG(o) = -12 kcal mol(-1)) is mediated by 27 residues of R135 near the coiled-coil apex. Formation of the R135-BtuB complex results in unfolding of R135 N- and C-terminal ends, inferred to be important for unfolding of the colicin T-domain. Small conformational changes occur in the BtuB cork and barrel domains but are insufficient to form a translocation channel. The absence of a channel and the peripheral binding of R135 imply that BtuB serves to bind the colicin, and that the coiled-coil delivers the colicin to a neighboring outer membrane protein for translocation, thus forming a colicin translocon. The translocator was concluded to be OmpF from the occlusion of OmpF channels by colicin E3.},

Pools of released and unreleased colicin A were harvested throughout colicin A induction. The amount of colicin A in each pool varied with the time of induction, allowing the definition of two sequential steps in colicin A release, one of which was dependent on Cal. Each step of colicin A release was differently affected in cells containing Cal mutants in which the N-terminal cysteine residue was substituted by either proline or threonine, preventing them from being acylated and matured. These Cal mutants were only observed in degP cells, indicating that the DegP protease cleaved the unacylated precursor of Cal. Cal was found in the insoluble fraction of the pools of released and unreleased colicin A together with the hetero-oligomers of colicin A and porins (colicins Au). The biogenesis of colicins Au was studied in temperature-sensitive secA and secY strains and found to be Sec-independent, indicating that they are formed by newly synthesized colicin A binding to mature porins already incorporated in the outer membrane. Cal is a lipoprotein similar to VirB7, a constituent of the type IV secretion system. It would interact with colicins Au to constitute the colicin A export machinery.},

abstract = {Discovering the functions of all genes is a central goal of contemporary biomedical research. Despite considerable effort, we are still far from achieving this goal in any metazoan organism. Collectively, the growing body of high-throughput functional genomics data provides evidence of gene function, but remains difficult to interpret. We constructed the first network of functional relationships for Drosophila melanogaster by integrating most of the available, comprehensive sets of genetic interaction, protein-protein interaction, and microarray expression data. The complete integrated network covers 85{\%} of the currently known genes, which we refined to a high confidence network that includes 20,000 functional relationships among 5,021 genes. An analysis of the network revealed a remarkable concordance with prior knowledge. Using the network, we were able to infer a set of high-confidence Gene Ontology biological process annotations on 483 of the roughly 5,000 previously unannotated genes. We also show that this approach is a means of inferring annotations on a class of genes that cannot be annotated based solely on sequence similarity. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of the network through reanalyzing gene expression data to both discover clusters of coregulated genes and compile a list of candidate genes related to specific biological processes. Here we present the the first genome-wide functional gene network in D. melanogaster. The network enables the exploration, mining, and reanalysis of experimental data, as well as the interpretation of new data. The inferred annotations provide testable hypotheses of previously uncharacterized genes.},

@article{Gilchrist2008,
abstract = {The Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) is a transcription regulatory complex that induces stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early transcription elongation and represses expression of several genes studied to date, including Drosophila Hsp70, mammalian proto-oncogene junB, and HIV RNA. To determine the full spectrum of NELF target genes in Drosophila, we performed a microarray analysis of S2 cells depleted of NELF and discovered that NELF RNAi affects many rapidly inducible genes involved in cellular responses to stimuli. Surprisingly, only one-third of NELF target genes were, like Hsp70, up-regulated by NELF-depletion, whereas the majority of target genes showed decreased expression levels upon NELF RNAi. Our data reveal that the presence of stalled Pol II at this latter group of genes enhances gene expression by maintaining a permissive chromatin architecture around the promoter-proximal region, and that loss of Pol II stalling at these promoters is accompanied by a significant increase in nucleosome occupancy and a decrease in histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation. These findings identify a novel, positive role for stalled Pol II in regulating gene expression and suggest that there is a dynamic interplay between stalled Pol II and chromatin structure.},

This growth in sequences has prompted an extension of UniProt accession number space from 6 to 10 characters. An increasing fraction of new sequences are identical to a sequence that already exists in the database with the majority of sequences coming from genome sequencing projects. We have created a new proteome identifier that uniquely identifies a particular assembly of a species and strain or subspecies to help users track the provenance of sequences. We present a new website that has been designed using a user-experience design process. We have introduced an annotation score for all entries in UniProt to represent the relative amount of knowledge known about each protein. These scores will be helpful in identifying which proteins are the best characterized and most informative for comparative analysis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is generally acknowledged that a functional understanding of a biological system can only be obtained by an understanding of the collective of molecular interactions in form of biological networks. Protein networks are one particular network type of special importance, because proteins form the functional base units of every biological cell. On a mesoscopic level of protein networks, modules are of significant importance because these building blocks may be the next elementary functional level above individual proteins allowing to gain insight into fundamental organizational principles of biological cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of five popular and four novel module detection algorithms. We study these module prediction methods for simulated benchmark networks as well as 10 biological protein interaction networks (PINs). A particular focus of our analysis is placed on the biological meaning of the predicted modules by utilizing the Gene Ontology (GO) database as gold standard for the definition of biological processes. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the results by perturbing the PINs simulating in this way our incomplete knowledge of protein networks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study reveals that there is a large heterogeneity among the different module prediction algorithms if one zooms-in the biological level of biological processes in the form of GO terms and all methods are severely affected by a slight perturbation of the networks. However, we also find pathways that are enriched in multiple modules, which could provide important information about the hierarchical organization of the system.},

abstract = {Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), which controls growth in response to nutrients, promotes ageing in multiple organisms. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe emerges as a valuable genetic model system to study TORC1 function and cellular ageing. Here we exploited the combinatorial action of rapamycin and caffeine, which inhibit fission yeast growth in a TORC1-dependent manner. We screened a deletion library, comprising ∼84{\%} of all nonessential fission yeast genes, for drug-resistant mutants. This screen identified 33 genes encoding functions such as transcription, kinases, mitochondrial respiration, biosynthesis, intra-cellular trafficking, and stress response. Among the corresponding mutants, 5 showed shortened and 21 showed increased maximal chronological lifespans; 15 of the latter mutants showed no further lifespan increase with rapamycin and might thus represent key targets downstream of TORC1. We pursued the long-lived sck2 mutant with additional functional analyses, revealing that the Sck2p kinase functions within the TORC1 network and is required for normal cell growth, global protein translation, and ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation in a nutrient-dependent manner. Notably, slow cell growth was associated with all long-lived mutants while oxidative-stress resistance was not.},

abstract = {Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are coding variants that introduce amino acid changes in their corresponding proteins. Because nsSNPs can affect protein function, they are believed to have the largest impact on human health compared with SNPs in other regions of the genome. Therefore, it is important to distinguish those nsSNPs that affect protein function from those that are functionally neutral. Here we provide an overview of amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods, which use sequence and/or structure to predict the effect of an AAS on protein function. Most methods predict approximately 25-30{\%} of human nsSNPs to negatively affect protein function, and such nsSNPs tend to be rare in the population. We discuss the utility of AAS prediction methods for Mendelian and complex diseases as well as their broader applications for understanding protein function.},

abstract = {At least half the pp60c-src in NIH 3T3-derived c-src overexpresser cells in modified by novel threonine and, possibly, serine phosphorylation within its amino 16 kd region during mitosis. At the same time, the tryptic phosphopeptide containing Ser 17, the site of cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, is either modified or dephosphorylated. While the amount of pp60c-src is not significantly altered, the in vitro-specific kinase activity of modified pp60c-src is enhanced 4- to 7-fold. Modified pp60c-src has the same tyrosine-containing tryptic phosphopeptides as pp60c-src from unsynchronized cells, indicating that activation is independent of Tyr 416/Tyr 527 phosphorylation. Electrophoretic mobility retardations indicated that endogenous pp60c-src and pp60v-src are similarly modified during mitosis. The modifications and enhanced activity disappear near the time of cell division. These results suggest that pp60c-src is regulated by and, in turn, may regulate mitosis-specific events in fibroblasts.},

abstract = {This review outlines recent insights into ligand recognition, channel gating and ion permeation for the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). These receptors are involved in the fast inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. Prototypical anion-selective members are the $\gamma$-amino butyric acid type A (GABA(A)), $\gamma$-amino butyric acid type C (GABA(C)) and glycine receptor. The cation-selective members are the 5-HT3 serotonin and nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors. They are the target for a wide variety of drugs and dysfunction in these receptors is associated with several diseases. We summarize recent structural knowledge in combination with electrophysiological data and molecular dynamic simulations, thereby describing key features of ligand binding, channel gating and ion permeation. A conserved cation-$\pi$ interaction between ligand and aromatic residues of the ligand binding site critically contributes to ligand recognition, as revealed by X-ray crystal structures of acetylcholine binding proteins, as well as the integral pLGICs, ELIC and GluCl. In addition, we summarize the possible downstream effects on gating of structural rearrangements in the extracellular ligand-binding domain, which mainly occur in loop C and loop F. These data are discussed in the context of different conformational states of the pore-forming domain observed in crystal structures of GLIC and GluCl, which likely represent the open pore conformation, and ELIC, which likely corresponds to a closed pore conformation. We conclude with a current structural view on the determinants of ion selection and permeation.},

abstract = {Protein function is often modulated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and therefore defining the partners of a protein helps to understand its activity. PPIs can be detected through different experimental approaches and are collected in several expert curated databases. These databases are used by researchers interested in examining detailed information on particular proteins. In many analyses the reliability of the characterization of the interactions becomes important and it might be necessary to select sets of PPIs of different confidence levels. To this goal, we generated HIPPIE (Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference), a human PPI dataset with a normalized scoring scheme that integrates multiple experimental PPI datasets. HIPPIE's scoring scheme has been optimized by human experts and a computer algorithm to reflect the amount and quality of evidence for a given PPI and we show that these scores correlate to the quality of the experimental characterization. The HIPPIE web tool (available at http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/tools/hippie) allows researchers to do network analyses focused on likely true PPI sets by generating subnetworks around proteins of interest at a specified confidence level.},

The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data.

Several protein quality control mechanisms degrade non-native proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to demonstrate that heat-shock triggers a large increase in the level of ubiquitylation associated with misfolding of cytosolic proteins. We discover that the Hul5 HECT ubiquitin ligase participates in this heat-shock stress response. Hul5 is required to maintain cell fitness after heat-shock and to degrade short-lived misfolded proteins. In addition, localization of Hul5 in the cytoplasm is important for its quality control function. We identify potential Hul5 substrates in heat-shock and physiological conditions to reveal that Hul5 is required for ubiquitylation of low-solubility cytosolic proteins including the Pin3 prion-like protein. These findings indicate that Hul5 is involved in a cytosolic protein quality control pathway that targets misfolded proteins for degradation.},

In this study, we employed IMAC followed by LC-MS/MS to identify phosphopeptides from eight individual AD and eight age-matched control postmortem human brain tissues. Using this approach, we identified 5569 phosphopeptides in frontal cortex across all 16 cases in which phosphopeptides represented 80{\%} of all peptide spectral counts collected following IMAC enrichment. Marker selection identified 253 significantly altered phosphopeptides by precursor intensity, changed by at least 1.75-fold relative to controls, with an empirical false discovery rate below 7{\%}. Approximately 21{\%} of all significantly altered phosphopeptides in AD tissue were derived from tau. Of the other 142 proteins hyperphosphorylated in AD, membrane, synapse, cell junction, and alternatively spliced proteins were overrepresented. Of these, we validated differential phosphorylation of HSP 27 (HSPB1) and crystallin-alpha-B (CRYAB) as hyperphosphorylated by Western blotting. We further identified a network of phosphorylated kinases, which coenriched with phosphorylated small HSPs. This supports a hypothesis that a number of kinases are regulating and/or regulated by the small HSP folding network.},

abstract = {E colicins are plasmid-coded, protein antibiotics which bind to the BtuB outer membrane receptor of Escherichia coli cells and are then translocated either to the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane in the case of the pore-forming colicin E1, or to the cytoplasm in the case of the enzymic colicins E2-E9. Translocation has been proposed to be dependent on a putative TolA box; a pentapeptide (DGSGW) located in the N-terminal 39 residues of several Tol-dependent colicins. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change each of the residues of the putative TolA box of colicin E9 to alanines. In the case of the two glycine residues, the resulting mutant proteins were indistinguishable from the native colicin E9 protein in a biological assay; whereas the other three residues when mutated to alanines resulted in a complete loss of biological activity. Mutagenesis of two serine residues flanking the putative TolA box, Ser34 and Ser40, to alanines did not abolish the biological activity of the mutant colicin E9, although the zones of growth inhibition were hazy and slow to form. The size of the zone of inhibition was significantly smaller than the control in the case of the Ser40Ala mutant. The ColE9/Im9 complex was isolated from the three biologically inactive TolA box alanine mutants. In competition assays all three mutant protein complexes were capable of protecting sensitive E. coli cells against killing by the native ColE9/Im9 complex. On removal of the Im9 protein from the three mutant ColE9/Im9 complexes, all three mutant colicins exhibited DNase activity. These results confirm the importance of the putative TolA box in the biological activity of colicin E9, and suggest that the TolA box has a role in the translocation of colicin E9.},

abstract = {The helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain is a common denominator in basal and specific transcription factors from the three super-kingdoms of life. At its core, the domain comprises of an open tri-helical bundle, which typically binds DNA with the 3rd helix. Drawing on the wealth of data that has accumulated over two decades since the discovery of the domain, we present an overview of the natural history of the HTH domain from the viewpoint of structural analysis and comparative genomics. In structural terms, the HTH domains have developed several elaborations on the basic 3-helical core, such as the tetra-helical bundle, the winged-helix and the ribbon-helix-helix type configurations. In functional terms, the HTH domains are present in the most prevalent transcription factors of all prokaryotic genomes and some eukaryotic genomes. They have been recruited to a wide range of functions beyond transcription regulation, which include DNA repair and replication, RNA metabolism and protein-protein interactions in diverse signaling contexts. Beyond their basic role in mediating macromolecular interactions, the HTH domains have also been incorporated into the catalytic domains of diverse enzymes. We discuss the general domain architectural themes that have arisen amongst the HTH domains as a result of their recruitment to these diverse functions. We present a natural classification, higher-order relationships and phyletic pattern analysis of all the major families of HTH domains. This reconstruction suggests that there were at least 6-11 different HTH domains in the last universal common ancestor of all life forms, which covered much of the structural diversity and part of the functional versatility of the extant representatives of this domain. In prokaryotes the total number of HTH domains per genome shows a strong power-equation type scaling with the gene number per genome. However, the HTH domains in two-component signaling pathways show a linear scaling with gene number, in contrast to the non-linear scaling of HTH domains in single-component systems and sigma factors. These observations point to distinct evolutionary forces in the emergence of different signaling systems with HTH transcription factors. The archaea and bacteria share a number of ancient families of specific HTH transcription factors. However, they do not share any orthologous HTH proteins in the basal transcription apparatus. This differential relationship of their basal and specific transcriptional machinery poses an apparent conundrum regarding the origins of their transcription apparatus.},

The transporter is a bowl-shaped trimer with a solvent-filled extracellular basin extending halfway across the membrane bilayer. At the bottom of the basin are three independent binding sites, each cradled by two helical hairpins, reaching from opposite sides of the membrane. We propose that transport of glutamate is achieved by movements of the hairpins that allow alternating access to either side of the membrane.},

abstract = {Network analysis provides a powerful framework for the interpretation of genome-wide data. While static network approaches have proved fruitful, there is increasing interest in the insights gained from the analysis of cellular networks under different conditions. In this work, we study the effect of stress on cellular networks in fission yeast. Stress elicits a sophisticated and large scale cellular response, involving a shift of resources from cell growth and metabolism towards protection and maintenance. Previous work has suggested that these changes can be appreciated at the network level. In this paper, we study two types of cellular networks: gene co-regulation networks and weighted protein interaction networks. We show that in response to oxidative stress, the co-regulation networks re-organize towards a more modularised structure: while sets of genes become more tightly co-regulated, co-regulation between these modules is decreased. This shift translates into longer average shortest path length, increased transitivity, and decreased modular overlap in these networks. We also find a similar change in structure in the weighted protein interaction network in response to both oxidative stress and nitrogen starvation, confirming and extending previous findings. These changes in network structure could represent an increase in network robustness and/or the emergence of more specialised functional modules. Additionally, we find stress induces tighter co-regulation of non-coding RNAs, decreased functional importance of splicing factors, as well as changes in the centrality of genes involved in chromatin organization, cytoskeleton organization, cell division, and protein turnover.},

abstract = {Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) are the two major mechanisms involved in brain energetics. In this article we propose that the sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are driven by age-related damage to macromolecules and organelles which results in the following series of dynamic processes. (1) Metabolic alteration: Upregulation of OxPhos activity by dysfunctional neurons. (2) Natural selection: Competition for the limited energy substrates between neurons with normal OxPhos activity [Type (1)] and dysfunctional neurons with increased OxPhos [Type (2)]. (3) Propagation, due to the fact that Type (1) neurons are outcompeted for limited substrate by Type (2) neurons which, because of increased ROS production, eventually become dysfunctional and die. Otto Warburg, in his studies of the origin of cancer, discovered that most cancer cells are characterized by an increase in glycolytic activity-a property which confers a selective advantage in oncologic environments.

abstract = {Folding and function may impose different requirements on the amino acid sequences of proteins, thus potentially giving rise to conflict. Such a conflict, or frustration, can result in the formation of partially misfolded intermediates that can compromise folding and promote aggregation. We investigate this phenomenon by studying frataxin, a protein whose normal function is to facilitate the formation of iron-sulfur clusters but whose mutations are associated with Friedreich's ataxia. To characterize the folding pathway of this protein we carry out a $\Phi$-value analysis and use the resulting structural information to determine the structure of the folding transition state, which we then validate by a second round of rationally designed mutagenesis. The analysis of the transition-state structure reveals that the regions involved in the folding process are highly aggregation-prone. By contrast, the regions that are functionally important are partially misfolded in the transition state but highly resistant to aggregation. Taken together, these results indicate that in frataxin the competition between folding and function creates the possibility of misfolding, and that to prevent aggregation the amino acid sequence of this protein is optimized to be highly resistant to aggregation in the regions involved in misfolding.},

A modification based on the Smith Waterman algorithm for sequence alignment enables the automatic identification and growth of the most structurally similar local alignments irrespective of length and composition. The method can also be used in a search mode to match substructures. Roughly five minutes is required to find all Greek-key motifs in a protein of 100 residues.

abstract = {Motivation: Protein function prediction is one of the major tasks of bioinformatics that can help in wide range of biological problems such as understanding disease mechanisms or finding drug targets. Many methods are available for predicting protein functions from sequence based features, protein-protein interaction networks, protein structure or literature. However, other than sequence, most of the features are difficult to obtain or not available for many proteins thereby limiting their scope. Furthermore, the performance of sequence-based function prediction methods is often lower than methods that incorporate multiple features and predicting protein functions may require a lot of time. Results: We developed a novel method for predicting protein functions from sequence alone which combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity based predictions. Our CNN model scans the sequence for motifs which are predictive for protein functions and combines this with functions of similar proteins (if available). We evaluate the performance of DeepGOPlus using the CAFA3 evaluation measures and achieve an Fmax of 0.390, 0.557 and 0.614 for BPO, MFO and CCO evaluations, respectively. These results would have made DeepGOPlus one of the three best predictors in CCO and the second best performing method in the BPO and MFO evaluations. We also compare DeepGOPlus with state-of-the-art methods such as DeepText2GO and GOLabeler on another dataset. DeepGOPlus can annotate around 40 protein sequences per second on common hardware, thereby making fast and accurate function predictions available for a wide range of proteins.},

abstract = {This work presents a novel procedure for computing (1) distances between nodes of a weighted, undirected, graph, called the Euclidean Commute Time Distance (ECTD), and (2) a subspace projection of the nodes of the graph that preserves as much variance as possible, in terms of the ECTD - a principal components analysis of the graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the graph. The model assigns transition probabilities to the links between nodes, so that a random walker can jump from node to node. A quantity, called the average commute time, computes the average time taken by a random walker for reaching node j for the first time when starting from node i, and coming back to node i. The square root of this quantity, the ECTD, is a distance measure between any two nodes, and has the nice property of decreasing when the number of paths connecting two nodes increases and when the "length" of any path decreases. The ECTD can be computed from the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, which is a kernel. We finally define the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of a graph as the subspace projection that preserves as much variance as possible, in terms of the ECTD. This graph PCA has some interesting links with spectral graph theory, in particular spectral clustering. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

For a set of representative examples, we demonstrate that YRB highlighting intuitively visualizes segments on protein surfaces that contribute to specificity in protein-protein interfaces, including Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes, the SNARE complex and a transmembrane domain.

abstract = {HnRNP L is a ubiquitous splicing-regulatory protein that is critical for the development and function of mammalian T cells. Previous work has identified a few targets of hnRNP L-dependent alternative splicing in T cells and has described transcriptome-wide association of hnRNP L with RNA. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of hnRNP L on mRNA expression remains lacking. Here we use next-generation sequencing to identify transcriptome changes upon depletion of hnRNP L in a model T-cell line. We demonstrate that hnRNP L primarily regulates cassette-type alternative splicing, with minimal impact of hnRNP L depletion on transcript abundance, intron retention, or other modes of alternative splicing. Strikingly, we find that binding of hnRNP L within or flanking an exon largely correlates with exon repression by hnRNP L. In contrast, exons that are enhanced by hnRNP L generally lack proximal hnRNP L binding. Notably, these hnRNP L-enhanced exons share sequence and context features that correlate with poor nucleosome positioning, suggesting that hnRNP may enhance inclusion of a subset of exons via a cotranscriptional or epigenetic mechanism. Our data demonstrate that hnRNP L controls inclusion of a broad spectrum of alternative cassette exons in T cells and suggest both direct RNA regulation as well as indirect mechanisms sensitive to the epigenetic landscape.},

@article{Rost2002,
abstract = {The level of sequence similarity that implies similarity in protein structure is well established. Recently, many groups proposed thresholds for similarity in sequence implying similarity in enzymatic function. All previous results suggest the strong conservation of enzymatic function above levels of 50{\%} pairwise sequence identity. Here, I argue that all groups substantially overestimated the conservation of enzyme function because their data sets were either too biased, or too small. An unbiased analysis suggested that less than 30{\%} of the pair fragments above 50{\%} sequence identity have entirely identical EC numbers. Another surprising finding was that even BLAST E-values below 10-50 did not suffice to automatically transfer enzyme function without errors. As expected, most misclassifications originated from similarities in relatively short regions and/or from transferring annotations for different domains. Both problems cannot be corrected easily by adjusting the thresholds for automatic transfer of genome annotations. A score relating sequence identity to alignment length (distance from HSSP-threshold) outperformed statistical BLAST scores for high sequence similarity. In particular, the distance score allowed error-free transfer of enzyme function for the 10{\%} most similar enzyme pairs. The results illustrated how difficult it is to assess the conservation of protein function and to guarantee error-free genome annotations, in general: sets with millions of pair comparisons might not suffice to arrive at statistically significant conclusions. In practice, the revised detailed estimates for the sequence conservation of enzyme function may provide important benchmarks for everyday sequence analysis and for more cautious automatic genome annotations. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) is a widely used substitute for dithiothreitol (DTT) in the reduction of disulfide bonds in biochemical systems. Although TCEP has been recently shown to be a substrate of the flavin-dependent sulfhydryl oxidases, there is little quantitative information concerning the rate by which TCEP reduces other peptidic disulfide bonds. In this study, mono-, di-, and trimethyl ester analogues of TCEP were synthesized to evaluate the role of carboxylate anions in the reduction mechanism, and to expand the range of phosphine reductants. The effectiveness of all four phosphines relative to DTT has been determined using model disulfides, including a fluorescent disulfide-containing peptide (H(3)N(+)-VTWCGACKM-NH(2)), and with protein disulfide bonds in thioredoxin and sulfhydryl oxidase. Mono-, di-, and trimethyl esters exhibit phosphorus pK values of 6.8, 5.8, and 4.7, respectively, extending their reactivity with the model peptide to correspondingly lower pH values relative to that of TCEP (pK = 7.6). At pH 5.0, the order of reactivity is as follows: trimethyl- {\textgreater} dimethyl- {\textgreater} monomethyl- {\textgreater} TCEP {\textgreater} DTT; tmTCEP is 35-fold more reactive than TCEP, and DTT is essentially unreactive. Esterification also increases lipophilicity, allowing tmTCEP to penetrate phospholipid bilayers rapidly ({\textgreater}30-fold faster than DTT), whereas the parent TCEP is impermeant. Although more reactive than DTT toward small-molecule disulfides at pH 7.5, all phosphines are markedly less reactive toward protein disulfides at this pH. Molecular modeling suggests that the nucleophilic phosphorus of TCEP is more sterically crowded than the thiolate of DTT, contributing to the lower reactivity of the phosphine with protein disulfides. In sum, these data suggest that there is considerable scope for the synthesis of phosphine analogues tailored for specific applications in biological systems.},

After summarizing the longevity and cell death phenotypes in S. cerevisiae, this mini-review surveys the progress made in the study of both aging and programed cell death (PCD) in the yeast models, with a focus on the biology of S. pombe and C. albicans. Particular emphasis is placed on the similarities and differences between the two types of aging, replicative aging, and chronological aging, and between the three types of cell death, intrinsic apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and regulated necrosis, found in these yeasts. The development of the additional microbial models for aging and PCD in the other yeasts may help further elucidate the mechanisms of longevity and cell death regulation in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {For aligning DNA sequences that differ only by sequencing errors, or by equivalent errors from other sources, a greedy algorithm can be much faster than traditional dynamic programming approaches and yet produce an alignment that is guaranteed to be theoretically optimal. We introduce a new greedy alignment algorithm with particularly good performance and show that it computes the same alignment as does a certain dynamic programming algorithm, while executing over 10 times faster on appropriate data. An implementation of this algorithm is currently used in a program that assembles the UniGene database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.},

abstract = {Actin can be cleaved by trypsin or chymotrypsin into a large, autonomous fragment with approximately 80{\%} of the mass of the undegraded polypeptide. The protease resistant cores obtained with either enzyme are very similar. Although the fragment does not bind calcium ions and fails to polymerize to the filamentous form of actin or to stimulate myosin adenosine triphosphate (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) activity, it retains the full capacity to bind ATP. This observation suggests that it represents an independent functional unit. Cleavage of globular actin with either trypsin or chymotrypsin occurs with half times of 3 min, while that of filamentous actin proceeds with reaction half times of 20 min for trypsin and nearly 2 hr for chymotrypsin. Denaturation and renaturation of the trypsin resistant core shows that approximately 20{\%} of the molecules refold to functional forms which indicates that the fragment can be considered as an independent unit of folding as well.},

Although most of these DSBs are repaired without giving COs, little is known about the genetic requirements of NCO-specific recombination. We show that Fml1, the Fanconi anemia complementation group M (FANCM)-ortholog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, directs the formation of NCOs during meiosis in competition with the Mus81-dependent pro-CO pathway. We also define the Rad51/Dmc1-mediator Swi5-Sfr1 as a major determinant in biasing the recombination process in favor of Mus81, to ensure the appropriate amount of COs to guide meiotic chromosome segregation. The conservation of these proteins from yeast to humans suggests that this interplay may be a general feature of meiotic recombination.},

abstract = {Selective ion conduction across ion channel pores is central to cellular physiology. To understand the underlying principles of ion selectivity in tetrameric cation channels, we engineered a set of cation channel pores based on the nonselective NaK channel and determined their structures to high resolution. These structures showcase an ensemble of selectivity filters with a various number of contiguous ion binding sites ranging from 2 to 4, with each individual site maintaining a geometry and ligand environment virtually identical to that of equivalent sites in K(+) channel selectivity filters. Combined with single channel electrophysiology, we show that only the channel with four ion binding sites is K(+) selective, whereas those with two or three are nonselective and permeate Na(+) and K(+) equally well. These observations strongly suggest that the number of contiguous ion binding sites in a single file is the key determinant of the channel's selectivity properties and the presence of four sites in K(+) channels is essential for highly selective and efficient permeation of K(+) ions.},

abstract = {HIV-1 provirus, either as a chromosomal integrant or as an episomal plasmid in HeLa cells, forms a transcription-dependent gene loop structure between the 5'LTR promoter and 3'LTR poly(A) signal. Flavopiridol-mediated inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation blocks 5' to 3'LTR juxtaposition, indicating that this structure is maintained during transcription. Analysis of mutant or hybrid HIV-1 plasmids demonstrates that replacement of the 5'LTR promoter with CMV or the 3'LTR poly(A) signal with a synthetic element (SPA) permits gene loop formation, suggesting that these interactions are not retroviral specific. In addition, activation of the 5'LTR poly(A) signal or inactivation of the 3'LTR poly(A) signal abolishes gene loop formation. Overall, we demonstrate that both ongoing transcription and pre-mRNA processing are essential for gene loop formation, and predict that these structures represent a defining feature of active gene transcription.},

It should be stressed, however, that many complex biological and methodological issues are still open. This chapter first provides some background information and considerations associated with MSA techniques, concentrating on the alignment of protein sequences. Then, a practical overview of currently available methods and a description of their specific advantages and limitations are given, so that this chapter might constitute a helpful guide or starting point for researchers who aim to construct a reliable MSA.},

abstract = {Tau is the major microtubule associated protein (MAP) of a mature neuron. The other two neuronal MAPs are MAP1 and MAP2. An established function of MAPs is their interaction with tubulin and promotion of its assembly into microtubules and stabilization of the microtubule network. The microtubule assembly promoting activity of tau, a phosphoprotein, is regulated by its degree of phosphorylation. Normal adult human brain tau contains 2-3 moles phosphate/mole of tau protein. Hyperphosphorylation of tau depresses this biological activity of tau. In Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tau is {\~{}}three to four-fold more hyperphosphorylated than the normal adult brain tau and in this hyperphosphorylated state it is polymerized into paired helical filaments ([PHF) admixed with straight filaments (SF) forming neurofibrillary tangles. Tau is transiently hyperphosphorylated during development and during anesthesia and hypothermia but not to the same state as in AD brain. The abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in AD brain is distinguished from transiently hyperphosphorylated tau by its ability (1) to sequester normal tau, MAP1 and MAP2 and disrupt microtubules, and (2) to self-assemble into PHF/SF. The cytosolic abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau, because of oligomerization, unlike normal tau, is sedimentable and on self-assembly into PHF/SF, loses its ability to sequester normal MAPs. Some of the tau in AD brain is truncated which also promotes its self-assembly. Tau mutations found in frontotemporal dementia apparently promote its abnormal hyperphosphorylation. Thus, the AD abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (1) is distinguishable from both normal and transiently hyperphosphorylated taus, and (2) is inhibitory when in a cytosolic/oligomeric state but not when it is self-assembled into PHF/SF. Inhibition of abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau offers a promising therapeutic target for AD and related tauopathies.},

Studies of the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) gene have revealed that Aire promotes self-tolerance partly by inducing the transcription of a wide array of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), particularly in the thymus. The importance of Aire is highlighted by the fact that patients and mice defective in Aire expression develop a multi-organ autoimmune syndrome. In this review we discuss recent progress in our understanding of Aire's control of immune tolerance at the cellular and molecular levels, and also address the potential importance of Aire expression both in the thymus and in the peripheral lymphoid organs. The detection of both Aire and TSA expression by cell populations outside of the thymus raises the possibility that such expression may play a relevant role in the maintenance of self-tolerance.},

abstract = {We present HARP, a novel method for learning low dimensional embeddings of a graph's nodes which preserves higher-order structural features. Our proposed method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it, effectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (i.e. local minima) which can pose problems to non-convex optimization. HARP works by finding a smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This simplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve as good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed graph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of levels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the original graph. HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the state-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk, LINE, and Node2vec. Indeed, we demonstrate that applying HARP's hierarchical paradigm yields improved implementations for all three of these methods, as evaluated on classification tasks on real-world graphs such as DBLP, BlogCatalog, and CiteSeer, where we achieve a performance gain over the original implementations by up to 14{\%} Macro F1.},

Yet, there might be clustering to a lesser extent of pathway members in eukaryotic genomes, that assist coregulation of a set of functionally cooperating genes. We analyzed five sequenced eukaryotic genomes for clustering of genes assigned to the same pathway in the KEGG database. Between 98{\%} and 30{\%} of the analyzed pathways in a genome were found to exhibit significantly higher clustering levels than expected by chance. In descending order by the level of clustering, the genomes studied were Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, there is not much agreement between genomes in terms of which pathways are most clustered. Only seven of 69 pathways found in all species were significantly clustered in all five of them. This species-specific pattern of pathway clustering may reflect adaptations or evolutionary events unique to a particular lineage. We note that although operons are common in C. elegans, only 58{\%} of the pathways showed significant clustering, which is less than in human. Virtually all pathways in S. cerevisiae showed significant clustering.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:: Today, the base code of DNA is mostly determined through sequencing by synthesis as provided by the Illumina sequencers. Although highly accurate, resulting reads are short, making their analyses challenging. Recently, a new technology, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, was developed that could address these challenges, as it generates reads of several thousand bases. But, their broad application has been hampered by a high error rate. Therefore, hybrid approaches that use high-quality short reads to correct erroneous SMRT long reads have been developed. Still, current implementations have great demands on hardware, work only in well-defined computing infrastructures and reject a substantial amount of reads. This limits their usability considerably, especially in the case of large sequencing projects.

RESULTS:: Here we present proovread, a hybrid correction pipeline for SMRT reads, which can be flexibly adapted on existing hardware and infrastructure from a laptop to a high-performance computing cluster. On genomic and transcriptomic test cases covering Escherichia coli, Arabidopsis thaliana and human, proovread achieved accuracies up to 99.9{\%} and outperformed the existing hybrid correction programs. Furthermore, proovread-corrected sequences were longer and the throughput was higher. Thus, proovread combines the most accurate correction results with an excellent adaptability to the available hardware. It will therefore increase the applicability and value of SMRT sequencing. Availability and implementation: proovread is available at the following URL: http://proovread.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de CONTACT: : frank.foerster@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are sensors for a wide range of cellular and environmental signals, but elucidating how these channels respond to physical and chemical stimuli has been hampered by a lack of detailed structural information. Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4 {\AA} resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.},

The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online"--Back cover.

In this paper, we derive a new cost function for spectral clustering based on a measure of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing this cost function with respect to the partition leads to a new spectral clustering algorithm. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to an algorithm for learning the similarity matrix. We develop a tractable approximation of our cost function that is based on the power method of computing eigenvectors.},

abstract = {A mechanism is proposed for the RNA-catalyzed reactions involved in RNA splicing and RNase P hydrolysis of precursor tRNA. The mechanism postulates that chemical catalysis is facilitated by two divalent metal ions 3.9 A apart, as in phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by protein enzymes, such as the 3',5'-exonuclease of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. One metal ion activates the attacking water or sugar hydroxyl, while the other coordinates and stabilizes the oxyanion leaving group. Both ions act as Lewis acids and stabilize the expected pentacovalent transition state. The symmetry of a two-metal-ion catalytic site fits well with the known reaction pathway of group I self-splicing introns and can also be reconciled with emerging data on group II self-splicing introns, the spliceosome, and RNase P. The role of the RNA is to position the two catalytic metal ions and properly orient the substrates via three specific binding sites.},

abstract = {Background: The rapid development of sequencing technologies has provided access to environments that were either once thought inhospitable to life altogether or that contain too few cells to be analyzed using genomics approaches. While 16S rRNA gene microbial community sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of community composition and diversity over time and space, it only provides a crude estimate of microbial functional and metabolic potential. Alternatively, shotgun metagenomics allows comprehensive sampling of all genetic material in an environment, without any underlying primer biases. Until recently, one of the major bottlenecks of shotgun metagenomics has been the requirement for large initial DNA template quantities during library preparation. Results: Here, we investigate the effects of varying template concentrations across three low biomass library preparation protocols on their ability to accurately reconstruct a mock microbial community of known composition. We analyze the effects of input DNA quantity and library preparation method on library insert size, GC content, community composition, assembly quality and metagenomic binning. We found that library preparation method and the amount of starting material had significant impacts on the mock community metagenomes. In particular, GC content shifted towards more GC rich sequences at the lower input quantities regardless of library prep method, the number of low quality reads that could not be mapped to the reference genomes increased with decreasing input quantities, and the different library preparation methods had an impact on overall metagenomic community composition. Conclusions: This benchmark study provides recommendations for library creation of representative and minimally biased metagenome shotgun sequencing, enabling insights into functional attributes of low biomass ecosystem microbial communities.},

Here, the measure of the life span is the number of generations or divisions the yeast cell has undergone. The yeast cell is the organism, simplifying many aspects of aging research. Most importantly, the genetics of yeast is highly-developed and readily applicable to the dissection of longevity. Two candidate longevity genes have already been identified and are being characterized. Others will follow through the utilization of both the primary phenotype and the secondary phenotypes associated with aging in yeast. An ontogenetic theory of longevity that follows from the evolutionary biology of aging is put forward in this article. This theory has at its foundation the asymmetric reproduction of cells and organisms, and it makes specific predictions regarding the genetics, molecular mechanisms, and phenotypic features of longevity and senescence, including these: GTP-binding proteins will frequently be involved in determining longevity, asymmetric cell division will be often encountered during embryogenesis while binary fission will be more characteristic of somatic cell division, tumor cells of somatic origin will not be totipotent, and organisms that reproduce symmetrically will not have intrinsic limits to their longevity.},

abstract = {Human pre-mRNAs contain a definite number of exons and several pseudoexons which are located within intronic regions. We applied a computational approach to address the question of how pseudoexons are neglected in favor of exons and to possibly identify sequence elements preventing pseudoexon splicing. A search for possible splicing silencers was carried out on a pseudoexon selection that resembled exons in terms of splice site strength and exon splicing enhancer (ESE) representation; three motifs were retrieved through hexamer composition comparisons. One of these functions as a powerful silencer in transfection-based splicing assays and matches a previously identified silencer sequence with hnRNP H binding ability. The other two motifs are novel and failed to induce skipping of a constitutive exon, indicating that they might act as weak repressors or in synergy with other unidentified elements. All three motifs are enriched in pseudoexons compared with intronic regions and display higher frequencies in intronless gene-coding sequences compared with exons. We consider that a subpopulation of pseudoexons might rely on negative regulators for splicing repression; this hypothesis, if experimentally verified, might improve our understanding of exonic splicing regulatory sequences and provide the identification of a novel mutation target for human genetic diseases.},

Viability is defined as a percentage of live cells in a whole population.

This aspect represents the term 'cell vitality' defined as physiological capabilities of cells. It is important to note that cell viability and cell vitality represent two different aspects of cell functions, and both are required for the estimation of the physiological state of a cell after exposure to various types of stressors and chemical or physical factors. In this paper, we introduced a classification of available methods for estimating both viability and vitality in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells (wild-type and $\Delta$sod1 mutant) in which the effects of selected oxidants causing oxidative stress is evaluated.

In neurons, PFKFB3 is degraded constantly via the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)- CDH1. Glucose metabolism in neurons is directed mainly to the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to regeneration of reduced glutathione. In addition to their relevance to brain physiology and pathophysiology, these observations suggest that APC/C-CDH1 might link activation of glycolysis and cell proliferation as it is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle proteins.},

abstract = {The induction of apoptosis by p53 in response to cellular stress is its most conserved function and crucial for p53 tumor suppression. We recently reported that p53 directly induces oligomerization of the BH1,2,3 effector protein Bak, leading to outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (OMMP) with release of apoptotic activator proteins. One important mechanism by which p53 achieves OMMP is by forming an inhibitory complex with the anti-apoptotic BclXL protein. In contrast, the p53 complex with the Bcl2 homolog has not been interrogated. Here we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the p53-Bcl2 interaction using structural, biophysical, and mutational analyses. We have identified the p53 DNA binding domain as the binding interface for Bcl2 using solution NMR. The affinity of the p53-Bcl2 complex was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) to have a dominant component KD 535 +/- 24 nm. Moreover, in contrast to wild type p53, endogenous missense mutants of p53 are unable to form complexes with endogenous Bcl2 in human cancer cells. Functionally, these mutants are all completely or strongly compromised in mediating OMMP, as measured by cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. These data implicate p53-Bcl2 complexes in contributing to the direct mitochondrial p53 pathway of apoptosis and further support the notion that the DNA binding domain of p53 is a dual function domain, mediating both its transactivation function and its direct mitochondrial apoptotic function.},

The guidelines given are broadly applicable, intended to be stable over time, and cover all aspects from start to finish of a general assembly and annotation project. Intrinsic properties of genomes are discussed, as is the importance of using high quality DNA. Different sequencing technologies and generally applicable workflows for genome assembly are also detailed. We cover structural and functional annotation and encourage readers to also annotate transposable elements, something that is often omitted from annotation workflows. The importance of data management is stressed, and we give advice on where to submit data and how to make your results Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).},

abstract = {Driven by high-throughput sequencing techniques, modern genomic and clinical studies are in a strong need of integrative machine learning models for better use of vast volumes of heterogeneous information in the deep understanding of biological systems and the development of predictive models. How data from multiple sources (called multi-view data) are incorporated in a learning system is a key step for successful analysis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on omics and clinical data integration techniques, from a machine learning perspective, for various analyses such as prediction, clustering, dimension reduction and association. We shall show that Bayesian models are able to use prior information and model meas-urements with various distributions; tree-based methods can either build a tree with all features or collectively make a final decision based on trees learned from each view; kernel methods fuse the similarity matrices learned from individual views together for a final similarity matrix or learning model; network-based fusion methods are capable of inferring direct and in-direct associations in a heterogeneous network; matrix factorization models have potential to learn interactions among fea-tures from different views; and a range of deep neural networks can be integrated in multi-modal learning for capturing the complex mechanism of biological systems.},

abstract = {Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun) plants with reduced levels of the Calvin cycle enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase; EC 3.1.3.37) were produced using an antisense construct in which the expression of a tobacco SBPase cDNA clone was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter. The reduction in SBPase protein levels observed in the primary transformants correlated with the presence of the antisense construct and lower levels of the endogenous SBPase mRNA. No changes in the amounts of other Calvin cycle enzymes were detected using Western blot analysis. The SBPase antisense plants with less than 20{\%} of wild-type SBPase activity were observed to display a range of phenotypes, including chlorosis and reduced growth rates. Measurements of photosynthesis, using both light-dosage response and CO2 response curves, of T1 plants revealed a reduction in carbon assimilation rates, which was apparent in plants retaining 57{\%} of wild-type SBPase activity. Reductions were also observed in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II. This decrease in photosynthetic capacity was reflected in a reduction in the carbohydrate content of leaves. Analysis of carbohydrate status in fully expanded source leaves showed a shift in carbon allocation away from starch, whilst sucrose levels were maintained in all but the most severely affected plants. Plants with less than 15{\%} of wild-type SBPase activity were found to contain less than 5{\%} of wild-type starch levels. The results of this preliminary analysis indicate that SBPase activity may limit the rate of carbon assimilation.},

Other outer membrane defective strains such as tolC, lpp, and rfa mutations are also altered in their outer membrane permeability. In this study, electron microscopy and Western blot analyses were used to show that strains with mutations in each of the tol-pal genes formed outer membrane vesicles after growth in standard liquid or solid media. This phenotype was not observed in tolC and rfaD cells in the same conditions. A tolA deletion in three different Escherichia coli strains was shown to lead to elevated amounts of vesicles. These results, together with plasmid complementation experiments, indicated that the formation of vesicles resulted from the defect of any of the Tol-Pal proteins. The vesicles contained outer membrane trimeric porins correctly exposed at the cell surface. Pal outer membrane lipoprotein was also immunodetected in the vesicle fraction of tol strains. The results are discussed in view of the role of the Tol-Pal transenvelope proteins in maintaining outer membrane integrity by contributing to target or integrate newly synthesized components of this structure.},

abstract = {We have tested the effects of various mutations within SV40 T antigen DNA recognition sites I and II on specific T antigen binding using the DNase footprint technique. In addition, the replication of plasmid DNA templates carrying these T antigen binding site mutations was monitored by Southern analysis of transfected DNA in COS cells. Deletion mapping of site I sequences defined a central core of approximately 18 bp that is both necessary and sufficient for T antigen recognition; this region contains the site I contact nucleotides that were previously mapped using methylation-interference and methylation-protection experiments. A similar deletion analysis delineated sequences that impart specificity of binding to site II. We find that T antigen is capable of specific recognition of site II in the absence of site I sequences, indicating that binding to site II in vitro is not dependent on binding of T antigen at site I. Site II binding was not diminished by small deletion or substitution mutations that perturb the 27-bp palindrome central to binding site II, whereas extensive substitution of site II sequences completely eliminated specific site II binding. Analysis of the replication in COS7 cells of plasmids that contain these mutant origins revealed that sequences both at the late side of binding site I and within the site II palindrome are crucial for viral DNA replication, but are not involved in binding T antigen.},

We applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a classification technique in HMMBinder. Our method was tested on standard benchmark datasets.

abstract = {In excitable cells, voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels activate to initiate action potentials and then undergo fast and slow inactivation processes that terminate their ionic conductance. Inactivation is a hallmark of Na(V) channel function and is critical for control of membrane excitability, but the structural basis for this process has remained elusive. Here we report crystallographic snapshots of the wild-type Na(V)Ab channel from Arcobacter butzleri captured in two potentially inactivated states at 3.2 {\AA} resolution. Compared to previous structures of Na(V)Ab channels with cysteine mutations in the pore-lining S6 helices (ref. 4), the S6 helices and the intracellular activation gate have undergone significant rearrangements: one pair of S6 helices has collapsed towards the central pore axis and the other S6 pair has moved outward to produce a striking dimer-of-dimers configuration. An increase in global structural asymmetry is observed throughout our wild-type Na(V)Ab models, reshaping the ion selectivity filter at the extracellular end of the pore, the central cavity and its residues that are analogous to the mammalian drug receptor site, and the lateral pore fenestrations. The voltage-sensing domains have also shifted around the perimeter of the pore module in wild-type Na(V)Ab, compared to the mutant channel, and local structural changes identify a conserved interaction network that connects distant molecular determinants involved in Na(V) channel gating and inactivation. These potential inactivated-state structures provide new insights into Na(V) channel gating and novel avenues to drug development and therapy for a range of debilitating Na(V) channelopathies.},

Our prior work used a similar approach to analyze mutations within a single protein. An analysis of the contents of SAAPdb indicates that there are clear differences in the sequence and structural characteristics of SNPs and PDs, and that PDs are more often explained by our structural analysis.

A small percentage of individuals with normal antemortem psychometric scores, after adjustments for age and education, meet the neuropathological criteria for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD; these individuals have been termed 'preclinical' or 'asymptomatic' AD (PCAD). In this study, we employed the immunochemical slot-blot method and two-dimensional gel-based redox proteomics to observe differences in protein levels and oxidative modifications between groups with equal levels of AD pathology who differ in regards to clinical symptoms of memory impairment. Results of global oxidative stress measurements revealed significantly higher levels of protein carbonyls in the MCI inferior parietal lobule (IPL) relative to PCAD (and controls), despite equal levels of neuropathology. Proteomics analysis of the IPL revealed differences in protein levels and specific carbonylation that are consistent with preservation of memory in PCAD and apparent memory decline in MCI. Our data suggest that marked changes occur at the protein level in MCI that may cause or reflect memory loss and other AD symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOS Press and the authors.

It is closely tied to the underground scene, but has also been used therapeutically as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Both scientific as well as newspaper articles communicate faulty or incomplete information on the origin of MDMA and the role of the German pharmaceutical-chemical company Merck in its development. One of the most common misconceptions is that the substance was synthesized with the goal of creating an anorectic but was not marketed by Merck because of side effects. It was our aim to clarify the circumstances of MDMA's discovery at Merck. An interdisciplinary working group conducted a comprehensive analysis of the original documents in Merck's historical archive in Darmstadt, Germany. It could be revealed that MDMA was in fact mentioned for the first time in files from 1912, but not under this name. In the lab journals it was called "Methylsafrylamin". In a patent certificate it was mentioned only with its chemical structure. Merck applied for this patent to protect an alternative chemical method for synthesizing the styptic hydrastinine, not appetite suppressants. MDMA was not the key substance in this patent, only a precursor. Archive documents revealed that Merck's scientists did not perform basic pharmacological tests with MDMA (now called "Safrylmethylamin") before 1927. These tests were halted for economic reasons. In the 1950s, primitive toxicological studies were conducted but MDMA was not tested in humans.},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

abstract = {ColA is a colicinogenic plasmid of 6.72 kb. It is compatible with ColE1 but not with ColK. Transposon insertion mutagenesis as well as complementation studies have been carried out to investigate the location of the various functional regions of this plasmid. Four independent ColA::Tn1 and one ColA::Tn3 plasmids were isolated and the locations of insertions were determined. From these plasmids, six different deletion mutants were constructed. In addition, various restriction fragments of ColA have been cloned into pUC8 to carry out complementation studies. We have thus confirmed the location of the DNA regions involved in colicin production, colicin release and immunity function. The DNA region involved in conjugal mobility promoted by R64 drd11 has been identified and we have demonstrated that the ColE1 mobility proteins can act in trans on the bom (basis of mobility) site of ColA. The location of this site, as well as the region involved in stable maintenance of ColA, have also been determined. These results are discussed with regard to the homology in nucleotide sequence between ColA and ColE1.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel model for learning graph representations, which generates a low-dimensional vector representation for each vertex by capturing the graph structural information. Different from other previous research efforts, we adopt a random surfing model to capture graph structural information directly, instead of using the samplingbased method for generating linear sequences proposed by Perozzi et al. (2014). The advantages of our approach will be illustrated from both theorical and empirical perspectives. We also give a new perspective for the matrix factorization method proposed by Levy and Goldberg (2014), in which the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix is considered as an analytical solution to the objective function of the skipgram model with negative sampling proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013). Unlike their approach which involves the use of the SVD for finding the low-dimensitonal projections from the PMI matrix, however, the stacked denoising autoencoder is introduced in our model to extract complex features and model non-linearities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on clustering and visualization tasks, employing the learned vertex representations as features. Empirical results on datasets of varying sizes show that our model outperforms other stat-of-The-Art models in such tasks.},

abstract = {We have developed models of Alzheimer's disease in Drosophila melanogaster by expressing the A$\beta$ peptides that accumulate in human disease. Expression of wild-type and Arctic mutant (Glu22Gly) A$\beta$1-42 peptides in Drosophila neural tissue results in intracellular A$\beta$ accumulation followed by non-amyloid aggregates that resemble diffuse plaques. These histological changes are associated with progressive locomotor deficits and vacuolation of the brain and premature death of the flies. The severity of the neurodegeneration is proportional to the propensity of the expressed A$\beta$ peptide to form oligomers. The fly phenotype is rescued by treatment with Congo Red that reduces A$\beta$ aggregation in vitro. Our model demonstrates that intracellular accumulation and non-amyloid aggregates of A$\beta$ are sufficient to cause the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover it provides a platform to dissect the pathways of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and to develop novel therapeutic interventions. {\textcopyright} 2005 IBRO.

abstract = {The relationship between gut microbial metabolism and mental health is one of the most intriguing and controversial topics in microbiome research. Bidirectional microbiota–gut–brain communication has mostly been explored in animal models, with human research lagging behind. Large-scale metagenomics studies could facilitate the translational process, but their interpretation is hampered by a lack of dedicated reference databases and tools to study the microbial neuroactive potential. Surveying a large microbiome population cohort (Flemish Gut Flora Project, n = 1,054) with validation in independent data sets (n total = 1,070), we studied how microbiome features correlate with host quality of life and depression. Butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus bacteria were consistently associated with higher quality of life indicators. Together with Dialister, Coprococcus spp. were also depleted in depression, even after correcting for the confounding effects of antidepressants. Using a module-based analytical framework, we assembled a catalogue of neuroactive potential of sequenced gut prokaryotes. Gut–brain module analysis of faecal metagenomes identified the microbial synthesis potential of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid as correlating positively with mental quality of life and indicated a potential role of microbial $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid production in depression. Our results provide population-scale evidence for microbiome links to mental health, while emphasizing confounder importance.},

However, conventional drug conjugation strategies yield heterogenous conjugates with relatively narrow therapeutic index (maximum tolerated dose/curative dose). Using leads from our previously described phage display-based method to predict suitable conjugation sites, we engineered cysteine substitutions at positions on light and heavy chains that provide reactive thiol groups and do not perturb immunoglobulin folding and assembly, or alter antigen binding. When conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E, an antibody against the ovarian cancer antigen MUC16 is as efficacious as a conventional conjugate in mouse xenograft models. Moreover, it is tolerated at higher doses in rats and cynomolgus monkeys than the same conjugate prepared by conventional approaches. The favorable in vivo properties of the near-homogenous composition of this conjugate suggest that our strategy offers a general approach to retaining the antitumor efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates, while minimizing their systemic toxicity.},

abstract = {In this study, a reverse-engineering strategy was used to infer and analyze the structure and function of an aging and glucose repressed gene regulatory network in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method uses transcriptional perturbations to model the functional interactions between genes as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. The resulting network model correctly identified the known interactions of key regulators in a 10-gene network from the Snf1 signaling pathway, which is required for expression of glucose-repressed genes upon calorie restriction. The majority of interactions predicted by the network model were confirmed using promoter-reporter gene fusions in gene-deletion mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, revealing a more complex network architecture than previously appreciated. The reverse-engineered network model also predicted an unexpected role for transcriptional regulation of the SNF1 gene by hexose kinase enzyme/transcriptional repressor Hxk2, Mediator subunit Med8, and transcriptional repressor Mig1. These interactions were validated experimentally and used to design new experiments demonstrating Snf1 and its transcriptional regulators Hxk2 and Mig1 as modulators of chronological lifespan. This work demonstrates the value of using network inference methods to identify and characterize the regulators of complex phenotypes, such as aging.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {The G2 DNA damage checkpoint ensures maintenance of cell viability by delaying progression into mitosis in cells which have suffered genomic damage. It is controlled by a number of proteins which are hypothesized to transduce signals through cell cycle regulators to delay activation of p34cdc2. Studies in mammalian cells have correlated induction of inhibitory tyrosine 15 (Y15) phosphorylation on p34cdc2 with the response to DNA damage. However, genetic studies in fission yeast have suggested that the major Y15 kinase, p107wee1, is not required for the cell cycle delay in response to DNA damage, although it is required for survival after irradiation. Thus, the target of the checkpoint, and hence the mechanism of cell cycle delay, remains unknown. We show here that Y15 phosphorylation is maintained in checkpoint-arrested fission yeast cells. Further, wee1 is required for cell cycle arrest induced by up-regulation of an essential component of this checkpoint, chk1. We observed that p107wee1 is hyperphosphorylated in cells delayed by chk1 overexpression or UV irradiation, and that p56chk1 can phosphorylate p107wee1 directly in vitro. These observations suggest that in response to DNA damage p107wee1 is phosphorylated by p56chk1 in vivo, and this results in maintenance of Y15 phosphorylation and hence G2 delay. In the absence of wee1, other Y15 kinases, such as p66mik1, may partially substitute for p107wee1 to induce cell cycle delay, but this wee1-independent delay is insufficient to maintain full viability. This study establishes a link between a G2 DNA damage checkpoint function and a core cell cycle regulator.},

Its extensive use as a screening method has yielded many published lists of genes that play novel roles in higher eukaryotes. However, the usefulness of this information is potentially limited by the occurrence of unintended off-target effects. Here we review the potential causes of off-target effects and the impact of this phenomenon in interpreting the results of high-throughput RNAi screens. In addition to targeting the intended gene product, artificial short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can produce off-target effects by down-regulating the expression of multiple mRNAs through microRNA-like targeting of the 3' untranslated region. We examine why this phenomenon can produce high hit rates in siRNA screens and why independent validation of screening results is critical for the approach to yield new biological insights.},

In Escherichia coli, asymmetric intermediates of GroEL are formed with the co-chaperonin GroES and nucleotides bound only to one of the seven-subunit rings (the cis ring) and not to the opposing ring (the trans ring). The structure of the GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 complex reveals how large en bloc movements of the cis ring's intermediate and apical domains enable bound GroES to stabilize a folding chamber with ADP confined to the cis ring. Elevation and twist of the apical domains double the volume of the central cavity and bury hydrophobic peptide-binding residues in the interface with GroES, as well as between GroEL subunits, leaving a hydrophilic cavity lining that is conducive to protein folding. An inward tilt of the cis equatorial domain causes an outward tilt in the trans ring that opposes the binding of a second GroES. When combined with new functional results, this negative allosteric mechanism suggests a model for an ATP-driven folding cycle that requires a double toroid.},

The highly selective, efficient and localized action of Pol III at its minute genomic targets is made possible by a handful of cis-acting regulatory elements, located within the transcribed region (where they are bound by the multisubunit assembly factor TFIIIC) and/or upstream of the transcription start site. Most of them participate directly or indirectly in the ultimate recruitment of TFIIIB, a key multiprotein initiation factor able to direct, once assembled, multiple transcription cycles by Pol III. But the peculiar efficiency and selectivity of Pol III transcription also depends on its ability to recognize very simple and precisely positioned termination signals. Studies in the last few years have significantly expanded the set of known Pol III-associated loci in genomes and, concomitantly, have revealed unexpected features of Pol III cis-regulatory elements in terms of variety, function, genomic location and potential contribution to transcriptome complexity. Here we review, in a historical perspective, well established and newly acquired knowledge about Pol III transcription control elements, with the aim of providing a useful reference for future studies of the Pol III system, which we anticipate will be numerous and intriguing for years to come.},

In this study, we show for the first time that human taste thresholds are plastic and are lowered by modulation of systemic monoamines. Measurement of taste function in healthy humans before and after a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, NA reuptake inhibitor, or placebo showed that enhancing 5-HT significantly reduced the sucrose taste threshold by 27{\%} and the quinine taste threshold by 53{\%}. In contrast, enhancing NA significantly reduced bitter taste threshold by 39{\%} and sour threshold by 22{\%}. In addition, the anxiety level was positively correlated with bitter and salt taste thresholds. We show that 5-HT and NA participate in setting taste thresholds, that human taste in normal healthy subjects is plastic, and that modulation of these neurotransmitters has distinct effects on different taste modalities. We present a model to explain these findings. In addition, we show that the general anxiety level is directly related to taste perception, suggesting that altered taste and appetite seen in affective disorders may reflect an actual change in the gustatory system.},

abstract = {Enzyme function conservation has been used to derive the threshold of sequence identity necessary to transfer function from a protein of known function to an unknown protein. Using pairwise sequence comparison, several studies suggested that when the sequence identity is above 40{\%}, enzyme function is well conserved. In contrast, Rost argued that because of database bias, the results from such simple pairwise comparisons might be misleading. Thus, by grouping enzyme sequences into families based on sequence similarity and selecting representative sequences for comparison, he showed that enzyme function starts to diverge quickly when the sequence identity is below 70{\%}. Here, we employ a strategy similar to Rost's to reduce the database bias; however, we classify enzyme families based not only on sequence similarity, but also on functional similarity, i.e. sequences in each family must have the same four digits or the same first three digits of the enzyme commission (EC) number. Furthermore, instead of selecting representative sequences for comparison, we calculate the function conservation of each enzyme family and then average the degree of enzyme function conservation across all enzyme families. Our analysis suggests that for functional transferability, 40{\%} sequence identity can still be used as a confident threshold to transfer the first three digits of an EC number; however, to transfer all four digits of an EC number, above 60{\%} sequence identity is needed to have at least 90{\%} accuracy. Moreover, when PSI-BLAST is used, the magnitude of the E-value is found to be weakly correlated with the extent of enzyme function conservation in the third iteration of PSI-BLAST. As a result, functional annotation based on the E-values from PSI-BLAST should be used with caution. We also show that by employing an enzyme family-specific sequence identity threshold above which 100{\%} functional conservation is required, functional inference of unknown sequences can be accurately accomplished. However, this comes at a cost: those true positive sequences below this threshold cannot be uniquely identified. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are prototypes for the pharmaceutically important family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Here we present atomic resolution structures of nicotine and carbamylcholine binding to AChBP, a water-soluble homolog of the ligand binding domain of nicotinic receptors and their family members, GABAA, GABAC, 5HT3 serotonin, and glycine receptors. Ligand binding is driven by enthalpy and is accompanied by conformational changes in the ligand binding site. Residues in the binding site contract around the ligand, with the largest movement in the C loop. As expected, the binding is characterized by substantial aromatic and hydrophobic contributions, but additionally there are close contacts between protein oxygens and positively charged groups in the ligands. The higher affinity of nicotine is due to a main chain hydrogen bond with the B loop and a closer packing of the aromatic groups. These structures will be useful tools for the development of new drugs involving nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-associated diseases.},

abstract = {The cornerstone of autotrophy, the CO(2)-fixing enzyme, d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), is hamstrung by slow catalysis and confusion between CO(2) and O(2) as substrates, an "abominably perplexing" puzzle, in Darwin's parlance. Here we argue that these characteristics stem from difficulty in binding the featureless CO(2) molecule, which forces specificity for the gaseous substrate to be determined largely or completely in the transition state. We hypothesize that natural selection for greater CO(2)/O(2) specificity, in response to reducing atmospheric CO(2):O(2) ratios, has resulted in a transition state for CO(2) addition in which the CO(2) moiety closely resembles a carboxylate group. This maximizes the structural difference between the transition states for carboxylation and the competing oxygenation, allowing better differentiation between them. However, increasing structural similarity between the carboxylation transition state and its carboxyketone product exposes the carboxyketone to the strong binding required to stabilize the transition state and causes the carboxyketone intermediate to bind so tightly that its cleavage to products is slowed. We assert that all Rubiscos may be nearly perfectly adapted to the differing CO(2), O(2), and thermal conditions in their subcellular environments, optimizing this compromise between CO(2)/O(2) specificity and the maximum rate of catalytic turnover. Our hypothesis explains the feeble rate enhancement displayed by Rubisco in processing the exogenously supplied carboxyketone intermediate, compared with its nonenzymatic hydrolysis, and the positive correlation between CO(2)/O(2) specificity and (12)C/(13)C fractionation. It further predicts that, because a more product-like transition state is more ordered (decreased entropy), the effectiveness of this strategy will deteriorate with increasing temperature.},

abstract = {Prediction and validation of microRNA (miRNA) targets are essential for understanding functions of miRNAs in gene regulation. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) allows direct identification of a huge number of Argonaute-bound target sequences that contain miRNA binding sites. By analysing data from CLIP studies, we identified a comprehensive list of sequence, thermodynamic and target structure features that are essential for target binding by miRNAs in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), coding sequence (CDS) region and 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of target messenger RNA (mRNA). The total energy of miRNA:target hybridization, a measure of target structural accessibility, is the only essential feature common for both seed and seedless sites in all three target regions. Furthermore, evolutionary conservation is an important discriminating feature for both seed and seedless sites. These features enabled us to develop novel statistical models for the predictions of both seed sites and broad classes of seedless sites. Through both intra-dataset validation and inter-dataset validation, our approach showed major improvements over established algorithms for predicting seed sites and a class of seedless sites. Furthermore, we observed good performance from cross-species validation, suggesting that our prediction framework can be valuable for broad application to other mammalian species and beyond. Transcriptome-wide binding site predictions enabled by our approach will greatly complement the available CLIP data, which only cover small fractions of transcriptomes and known miRNAs due to non-detectable levels of expression. Software and database tools based on the prediction models have been developed and are available through Sfold web server at http://sfold.wadsworth.org.},

abstract = {Motivation A large number of protein sequences are becoming available through the application of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies. Experimental functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over 40 000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem. Results We have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence. We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a cross-species protein-protein interaction network. Our approach specifically outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline methods such as BLAST, in particular for predicting cellular locations.

abstract = {The mechanisms utilized by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish, maintain, or reactivate from latent infection in the host are largely unknown but likely include genes that mediate adaptation to conditions encountered during persistence. Previously, a two-component signal transduction system, mprAB, was found to be required in M. tuberculosis for establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in a tissue- and stage-specific fashion. To begin to characterize the role of this system in M. tuberculosis physiology and virulence, a functional analysis of the mprA and mprB gene products was initiated. Here, evidence is presented demonstrating that sensor kinase MprB and response regulator MprA function as an intact signal-transducing pair in vitro and in vivo. Sensor kinase MprB can be autophosphorylated, can donate phosphate to MprA, and can act as a phospho-MprA phosphatase in vitro. Correspondingly, response regulator MprA can accept phosphate from MprB or from small phosphodonors including acetyl phosphate. Mutagenesis of residues His249 in MprB and Asp48 in MprA abolished the ability of these proteins to be phosphorylated in vitro. Introduction of these alleles into Mycobacterium bovis BCG attenuated virulence in macrophages in vivo. Together, these results support a role for the mprAB two-component system in M. tuberculosis physiology and pathogenesis. Characterization of two-component signal transduction systems will enhance our understanding of processes regulated by M. tuberculosis during acute and/or persistent infection in the host.},

abstract = {Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type III is a recently described condition involving a Glanzmann-type bleeding syndrome and leukocyte adhesion deficiency. This was ascribed to a defect of the FERMT3 gene resulting in abnormal expression of kindlin-3, a protein expressed in hematopoietic cells with a major role in the regulation of integrin activation. In this article, we describe a patient with a new mutation of FERMT3 and lack of kindlin-3 expression in platelets and leukocytes. We assayed quantitatively the first steps of kindlin-3-defective leukocyte adhesion, namely, initial bond formation, bond strengthening, and early spreading. Initial bond formation was readily stimulated with neutrophils stimulated by fMLF, and neutrophils and lymphocytes stimulated by a phorbol ester or Mn(2+). In contrast, attachment strengthening was defective in the patient's lymphocytes treated with PMA or Mn(2+), or fMLF-stimulated neutrophils. However, attachment strengthening was normal in patient's neutrophils treated with phorbol ester or Mn(2+). In addition, the patient's T lymphocytes displayed defective integrin-mediated spreading and a moderate but significant decrease of spreading on anti-CD3-coated surfaces. Patient's neutrophils displayed a drastic alteration of integrin-mediated spreading after fMLF or PMA stimulation, whereas signaling-independent Mn(2+) allowed significant spreading. In conclusion, the consequences of kindlin-3 deficiency on $\beta$(2) integrin function depend on both cell type and the stimulus used for integrin activation. Our results suggest looking for a possible kindlin-3 involvement in membrane dynamical event independent of integrin-mediated adhesion.},

abstract = {Gene loops are dynamic structures that juxtapose promoter–terminator regions of Pol II-transcribed genes. Although first described in yeast, gene loops have now been identified in yeast and mammalian cells. Looping requires components of the transcription preinitiation complex, the pre-mRNA 30-end processing machinery, and subunits of the nuclear pore complex. Loop formation is transcription-dependent, but neither basal nor activated transcription requires looping. Rather, looping appears to affect cellular memory of recent transcriptional activity, enabling a more rapid response to subsequent stimuli. The nuclear pore has been implicated in both memory and looping. Our working model is that loops are formed and/or maintained at the nuclear pore to facilitate hand-off of Pol II form the terminator to the promoter, thereby bypassing Pol II recruitment as the rate-limiting step in reactivation of transcription. Involvement of the nuclear pore also suggests that looping might facilitate mRNA export to the cytoplasm. The technology now exists to test these ideas.},

A set of structural effects, such as reduction in hydrophobic area, overpacking, backbone strain, and loss of electrostatic interactions, is used to represent the impact of single residue mutations on protein stability. A support vector machine (SVM) was trained on a set of mutations causative of disease, and a control set of non-disease causing mutations. In jack-knifed testing, the method identifies 74{\%} of disease mutations, with a false positive rate of 15{\%}. Evaluation of a set of in vitro mutagenesis data with the SVM established that the majority of disease mutations affect protein stability by 1 to 3 kcal/mol. The method's effective distinction between disease and non-disease variants, strongly supports the hypothesis that loss of protein stability is a major factor contributing to monogenic disease.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the "LINE," which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online.},

This protects the producing organism as it attempts to kill off competing bacteria. The cytotoxic domains of related colicins share a high degree of sequence identity, as do their corresponding immunity proteins, yet specificity and affinity are also high, with little non-cognate biological cross-protection evident under physiological conditions. We review recent work on DNase-specific immunity proteins, which shows that, although both cognate and non-cognate proteins can bind a single toxin, their affinities can differ by as much as 12 orders of magnitude. We have termed this mode of binding dual recognition, because the DNase-binding surface of an immunity protein is made up of two components, one conserved and the other variable. The strength of the binding interaction is dominated by the conserved residues, while neighbouring variable residues control specificity. Similar dual recognition systems may exist in other biological contexts, particularly where a protein must discriminate the right binding partner from numerous, structurally homologous alternatives.},

Here, we demonstrate conserved patterns of simple covariation between sequence evolution, codon usage, and mRNA level in E. coli, yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human that suggest that all observed trends stem largely from a unified underlying selective pressure. In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution that emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question the use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a key regulator of cardiac substrate selection and is regulated by both pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation and feedback inhibition. The extent to which chronic upregulation of PDK protein levels, acutely increased PDK activity and acute feedback inhibition limit PDH flux remains unclear because existing in vitro assessment methods inherently disrupt the regulation of the enzyme complex. We have demonstrated previously that hyperpolarised (13) C-labelled metabolic tracers coupled with MRS can monitor flux through PDH in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contributions of acute and chronic changes in PDK and PDH activities to in vivo myocardial PDH flux. We examined both fed and fasted rats with either hyperpolarised [1-(13) C]pyruvate alone or hyperpolarised [1-(13) C]pyruvate co-infused with malate [to modulate mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD(+) ) and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)/CoA ratios, which alter both PDH activity and flux]. To confirm the metabolic fate of infused malate, we performed in vitro (1) H NMR spectroscopy on cardiac tissue extracts. We observed that, in fed rats, where PDH activity was high, the presence of malate increased PDH flux by 27{\%}, whereas, in the fasted state, malate infusion had no effect on PDH flux. These observations suggest that pyruvate oxidation is limited by feedback inhibition from acetyl-CoA only when PDH activity is high. Therefore, in the case of PDH, and potentially other enzymes, hyperpolarised (13) C MRI can be used to assess noninvasively enzymatic regulation.

It overlapped the Mg2+ binding site obtained without T83, explaining the absence of peptide binding in the presence of Mg2+.

However, most of the focus in network studies has been on highly connected proteins ("hubs"). As a complementary notion, it is possible to define bottlenecks as proteins with a high betweenness centrality (i.e., network nodes that have many "shortest paths" going through them, analogous to major bridges and tunnels on a highway map). Bottlenecks are, in fact, key connector proteins with surprising functional and dynamic properties. In particular, they are more likely to be essential proteins. In fact, in regulatory and other directed networks, betweenness (i.e., "bottleneck-ness") is a much more significant indicator of essentiality than degree (i.e., "hub-ness"). Furthermore, bottlenecks correspond to the dynamic components of the interaction network-they are significantly less well coexpressed with their neighbors than non-bottlenecks, implying that expression dynamics is wired into the network topology.},

abstract = {TATA binding protein (TBP) is a central transcription factor used by all three cellular RNA polymerases. Changes in the levels of TBP have been shown to have selective effects on gene activity. Overexpression of TBP has been recently shown to contribute to cellular transformation, and elevated levels of TBP occur in a clinically significant proportion of human colon tumors relative to matched normal tissue. To understand the mechanisms by which TBP is regulated, we have analyzed whether activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane-bound tyrosine receptor kinase that is activated in a large number of human cancers, can serve to regulate cellular TBP. We show that treatment of mouse epidermal cells with EGF produces an increase in TBP levels, which can be blocked with an EGFR-specific inhibitor. In contrast, TBP levels remain unchanged after EGF treatment of EGFR null cells. EGF-mediated increases in TBP are regulated at the transcriptional level, as transient expression of the human TBP promoter is induced with EGF. This regulatory event is dependent upon the downstream activation of Ras and requires the activation of p38, JNK, and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases. The consequence of elevated TBP on gene expression was further determined. Transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) I and III was induced by EGF. Directly overexpressing TBP also stimulated transcription from these promoters. Thus, we have identified a new and important target of EGFR signaling, TBP, that contributes to EGF-mediated stimulation of RNA Pol I- and III-dependent gene activity. Since the cellular levels of the products of these genes, tRNAs and rRNAs, determine the translational capacity of cells, this event may be an important contributor to the transforming function of EGF.},

abstract = {Although the composition of the human microbiome is now well-studied, the microbiota's {\textgreater}8 million genes and their regulation remain largely uncharacterized. This knowledge gap is in part because of the difficulty of acquiring large numbers of samples amenable to functional studies of the microbiota. We conducted what is, to our knowledge, one of the first human microbiome studies in a well-phenotyped prospective cohort incorporating taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic profiling at multiple body sites using self-collected samples. Stool and saliva were provided by eight healthy subjects, with the former preserved by three different methods (freezing, ethanol, and RNAlater) to validate self-collection. Within-subject microbial species, gene, and transcript abundances were highly concordant across sampling methods, with only a small fraction of transcripts ( {\textless}5{\%}) displaying between-method variation. Next, we investigated relationships between the oral and gut microbial communities, identifying a subset of abundant oral microbes that routinely survive transit to the gut, but with minimal transcriptional activity there. Finally, systematic comparison of the gut metagenome and meta-transcriptome revealed that a substantial fraction (41{\%}) of microbial transcripts were not differentially regulated relative to their genomic abundances. Of the remainder, consistently underexpressed pathways included sporulation and amino acid biosynthesis, whereas up-regulated pathways included ribosome biogenesis and methanogenesis. Across subjects, metatranscriptional profiles were significantly more individualized than DNA-level functional profiles, but less variable than microbial composition, indicative of subject-specific whole-community regulation. The results thus detail relationships between community genomic potential and gene expression in the gut, and establish the feasibility of metatranscriptomic investigations in subject-collected and shipped samples.},

abstract = {Nuclease E colicins that exert their cytotoxic activity through either non-specific DNase or specific rRNase action are inhibited by immunity proteins in a high affinity interaction that gives complete protection to the producing host cell from the deleterious effects of the toxin. Previous X-ray crystallographic analysis of these systems has revealed that in both cases, the immunity protein inhibitor forms its highly stable complex with the enzyme by binding as an exosite inhibitor-adjacent to, but not obscuring, the enzyme active site. The structures of the free E9 DNase domain and its complex with an ssDNA substrate now show that inhibition is achieved without deformation of the enzyme and by occlusion of a limited number of residues of the enzyme critical in recognition and binding of the substrate that are 3' to the cleaved scissile phosphodiester. No sequence or structural similarity is evident between the two classes of cytotoxic domain, and the heterodimer interfaces are also dissimilar. Thus, whilst these structures suggest the basis for specificity in each case, they give few indications as to the basis for the remarkably strong binding that is observed. Structural analyses of complexes bearing single site mutations in the immunity protein at the heterodimer interface reveal further differences. For the DNases, a largely plastic interface is suggested, where optimal binding may be achieved in part by rigid body adjustment in the relative positions of inhibitor and enzyme. For the rRNases, a large solvent-filled cavity is found at the immunity-enzyme interface, suggesting that other considerations, such as that arising from the entropy contribution from bound water molecules, may have greater significance in the determination of rRNase complex affinity than for the DNases.},

abstract = {Ageing is associated with the development of several chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. To understand the genetic components driving cellular ageing in higher organisms, like ourselves, we study simple eukaryotic model systems which are more accessible and easier to manipulate than higher eukaryotes. This is possible due to the remarkably conserved ageing mechanisms that occurs between species. Here, we employ fission yeast one of the simplest eukaryotic model organisms to study cellular ageing. In this work, we de- coded the fission yeast deletion collection using our in-house developed pipeline, developed an improved version of Bar-seq along with a custom-developed analysis pipeline, determined a method for high-quality RNA extraction and RNA-seq from long-term quiescent yeast cells, and finally, performed a high-throughput Bar-seq screen to profile the chronological lifespan of our decoded strains. We describe bar- code decoding of 94{\%} of the gene deletions; validation of our Bar-seq developed method; identification of ncRNAs as elements important for the cellular quiescence maintenance; Bar-seq screening of the competitively grown decoded strains which identified several long-lived and short-lived mutants following glucose-starvation and cellular culture re-growth; and also, validation of the top hits using isogenic cell cultures revealing eight novel gene deletions important for the early life maintenance, as well as ten novel gene deletion mutants with pro-ageing effects. Overall, in addition to providing rich datasets, we describe several high-throughput methods that can be used for future genome-wide studies, whereby the complementarity of genomics and transcriptomics can be coupled together to further advance our understanding of the genetic factors underpinning cellular ageing in humans.},

@article{Towler2007,
abstract = {The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) system acts as a sensor of cellular energy status that is conserved in all eukaryotic cells. It is activated by increases in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio caused by metabolic stresses that either interfere with ATP production (eg, deprivation for glucose or oxygen) or that accelerate ATP consumption (eg, muscle contraction). Activation in response to increases in AMP involves phosphorylation by an upstream kinase, the tumor suppressor LKB1. In certain cells (eg, neurones, endothelial cells, and lymphocytes), AMPK can also be activated by a Ca(2+)-dependent and AMP-independent process involving phosphorylation by an alternate upstream kinase, CaMKKbeta. Once activated, AMPK switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP, while switching off ATP-consuming processes such as biosynthesis and cell growth and proliferation. The AMPK complex contains 3 subunits, with the alpha subunit being catalytic, the beta subunit containing a glycogen-sensing domain, and the gamma subunits containing 2 regulatory sites that bind the activating and inhibitory nucleotides AMP and ATP. Although it may have evolved to respond to metabolic stress at the cellular level, hormones and cytokines such as insulin, leptin, and adiponectin can interact with the system, and it now appears to play a key role in maintaining energy balance at the whole body level. The AMPK system may be partly responsible for the health benefits of exercise and is the target for the antidiabetic drug metformin. It is a key player in the development of new treatments for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {The TatA and TatB proteins are essential components of the twin arginine protein translocation pathway in Escherichia coli. C-terminal truncation analysis of the TatA protein revealed that a plasmid-expressed TatA protein shortened by 40 amino acids is still fully competent to support protein translocation. Similar truncation analysis of TatB indicated that the final 30 residues of TatB are dispensable for function. Further deletion experiments with TatB indicated that removal of even 70 residues from its C terminus still allowed significant transport. These results imply that the transmembrane and amphipathic helical regions of TatA and TatB are critical for their function but that the C-terminal domains are not essential for Tat transport activity. A chimeric protein comprising the N-terminal region of TatA fused to the amphipathic and C-terminal domains of TatB supports a low level of Tat activity in a strain in which the wild-type copy of either tatA or tatB (but not both) is deleted.},

This structure reveals a homohexamer comprised of individual subunits with a TIM barrel fold. The electron density for the UAG-encoded residue is distinct from any of the 21 natural amino acids. Instead it appears consistent with a lysine in amide-linkage to (4R,5R)-4-substituted-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We suggest that this amino acid be named l-pyrrolysine.},

Intron removal through pre-mRNA splicing is tightly linked to transcription by RNA polymerase II as it translocates along each gene. Here, we review recent evidence that transcription and splicing are functionally coupled. We focus on how RNA polymerase II elongation rates impact splicing through local regulation and transcriptional pausing within genes. Emerging concepts of how splicing-related changes in elongation might be achieved are highlighted. We place the interplay between transcription and splicing in the context of chromatin where nucleosome positioning influences elongation, and histone modifications participate directly in the recruitment of splicing regulators to nascent transcripts.},

More than 80{\%} of the sequence in previously reported CNV regions fell outside our estimated CNV boundaries, indicating that large ({\textgreater}100 kb) CNVs affect much less of the genome than initially reported.

abstract = {Recent analyses of biological and artificial networks have revealed a common network architecture, called scale-free topology. The origin of the scale-free topology has been explained by using growth and preferential attachment mechanisms. In a cell, proteins are the most important carriers of function, and are composed of domains as elemental units responsible for the physical interaction between protein pairs. Here, we propose a model for protein-protein interaction networks that reveals the emergence of two possible topologies. We show that depending on the number of randomly selected interacting domain pairs, the connectivity distribution follows either a scale-free distribution, even in the absence of the preferential attachment, or a normal distribution. This new approach only requires an evolutionary model of proteins (nodes) but not for the interactions (edges). The edges are added by means of random interaction of domain pairs. As a result, this model offers a new mechanistic explanation for understanding complex networks with a direct biological interpretation because only protein structures and their functions evolved through genetic modifications of amino acid sequences. These findings are supported by numerical simulations as well as experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The natively disordered N-terminal 83-aa translocation (T) domain of E group nuclease colicins recruits OmpF to a colicin-receptor complex in the outer membrane (OM) as well as TolB in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, the latter triggering translocation of the toxin across the OM. We have identified the 16-residue TolB binding epitope in the natively disordered T-domain of the nuclease colicin E9 (ColE9) and solved the crystal structure of the complex. ColE9 folds into a distorted hairpin within a canyon of the six-bladed beta-propeller of TolB, using two tryptophans to bolt the toxin to the canyon floor and numerous intramolecular hydrogen bonds to stabilize the bound conformation. This mode of binding enables colicin side chains to hydrogen-bond TolB residues in and around the channel that runs through the beta-propeller and that constitutes the binding site of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (Pal). Pal is a globular binding partner of TolB, and their association is known to be important for OM integrity. The structure is therefore consistent with translocation models wherein the colicin disrupts the TolB-Pal complex causing local instability of the OM as a prelude to toxin import. Intriguingly, Ca(2+) ions, which bind within the beta-propeller channel and switch the surface electrostatics from negative to positive, are needed for the negatively charged T-domain to bind TolB with an affinity equivalent to that of Pal and competitively displace it. Our study demonstrates that natively disordered proteins can compete with globular proteins for binding to folded scaffolds but that this can require cofactors such as metal ions to offset unfavorable interactions.},

abstract = {Although marine plastic pollution has been the focus of several studies, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the concentrations, characteristics and impacts of plastics in the oceans. This study aimed to quantify and characterize plastic debris in oceanic surface waters of the Antarctic Peninsula. Sampling was done through surface trawls, and mean debris concentration was estimated at 1,794 items.km −2 with an average weight of 27.8 g.km −2 . No statistical difference was found between the amount of mesoplastics (46{\%}) and microplastics (54{\%}). We found hard and flexible fragments, spheres and lines, in nine colors, composed mostly of polyurethane, polyamide, and polyethylene. An oceanographic dispersal model showed that, for at least seven years, sampled plastics likely did not originate from latitudes lower than 58°S. Analysis of epiplastic community diversity revealed bacteria, microalgae, and invertebrate groups adhered to debris.

abstract = {Complete knowledge of all direct and indirect interactions between proteins in a given cell would represent an important milestone towards a comprehensive description of cellular mechanisms and functions. Although this goal is still elusive, considerable progress has been made - particularly for certain model organisms and functional systems. Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of STRING, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {The assignment of function to proteins at a large scale is essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of life. However, only a very small percentage of the more than 179 million proteins in UniProtKB have Gene Ontology (GO) annotations supported by experimental evidence. In this paper, we proposed an integrated deep-learning-based classification model, named SDN2GO, to predict protein functions. SDN2GO applies convolutional neural networks to learn and extract features from sequences, protein domains, and known PPI networks, and then utilizes a weight classifier to integrate these features and achieve accurate predictions of GO terms. We constructed the training set and the independent test set according to the time-delayed principle of the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and compared it with two highly competitive methods and the classic BLAST method on the independent test set. The results show that our method outperforms others on each sub-ontology of GO. We also investigated the performance of using protein domain information. We learned from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process domain information and pre-trained a deep learning sub-model to extract the comprehensive features of domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the domain features we obtained are much improved the performance of our model. Our deep learning models together with the data pre-processing scripts are publicly available as an open source software at https://github.com/Charrick/SDN2GO.},

@article{DeSilva2006,
abstract = {Background: Present protein interaction network data sets include only interactions among subsets of the proteins in an organism. Previously this has been ignored, but in principle any global network analysis that only looks at partial data may be biased. Here we demonstrate the need to consider network sampling properties explicitly and from the outset in any analysis. Results: Here we study how properties of the yeast protein interaction network are affected by random and non-random sampling schemes using a range of different network statistics. Effects are shown to be independent of the inherent noise in protein interaction data. The effects of the incomplete nature of network data become very noticeable, especially for so-called network motifs. We also consider the effect of incomplete network data on functional and evolutionary inferences. Conclusion: Crucially, when only small, partial network data sets are considered, bias is virtually inevitable. Given the scope of effects considered here, previous analyses may have to be carefully reassessed: ignoring the fact that present network data are incomplete will severely affect our ability to understand biological system. {\textcopyright} 2006 de Silva et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In the MitTx-bound open state and in the previously determined low-pH desensitized state, TM2 is a discontinuous $\alpha$ helix in which the Gly-Ala-Ser selectivity filter adopts an extended, belt-like conformation, swapping the cytoplasmic one-third of TM2 with an adjacent subunit. Gly 443 residues of the selectivity filter provide a ring of three carbonyl oxygen atoms with a radius of ∼3.6 {\AA}, presenting an energetic barrier for hydrated ions. The ASIC1a-MitTx complex illuminates the mechanism of MitTx action, defines the structure of the selectivity filter of voltage-independent, sodium-selective ion channels, and captures the open state of an ASIC.},

They contain a channel through which proteins or protein-DNA complexes can be translocated. This translocation is driven by a number of cytoplasmic ATPases which might energize large conformational changes in the translocation complex. The family of T4SSs is very versatile, shown by the great variety of functions among family members. Some T4SSs are used by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria to translocate a wide variety of virulence factors into the host cell. Other T4SSs are utilized to mediate horizontal gene transfer, an event that greatly facilitates the adaptation to environmental changes and is the basis for the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Here we review the recent advances in the characterization of the architecture and mechanism of substrate transfer in a few representative T4SSs with a particular focus on their diversity of structure and function.},

abstract = {Statistical analyses were undertaken for putative transmembrane alpha-helices obtained from a database representing the subset of membrane proteins available in Swiss-Prot. The average length of a transmembrane alpha-helix was found to be 22-21 amino acids with a large variation around the mean. The transfer free energy from water to oil of a transmembrane alpha-helix in bitopic proteins, -48 kcal/mol, is higher than that in polytopic proteins, -39 kcal/mol, and is nearly identical to that obtained by assuming a random distribution of solely hydrophobic amino acids in the alpha-helix. The amino acid composition of hydrophobic residues is similar in bitopic and polytopic proteins. In contrast, the more polar the amino acids are, the less likely they are to be found in bitopic proteins compared to polytopic ones. This most likely reflects the ability of alpha-helical bundles to shield the polarity of residues from the hydrophobic bilayer. One half of all amino acids were distributed nonrandomly in both bitopic and polytopic proteins. A preference was found for tyrosine and tryptophan residues to be at the ends of transmembrane alpha-helices. Correlated distribution analysis of amino acid pairs indicated that most amino acids are independently distributed in each helix. Exceptions are cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan which appear to cluster closely to one another and glycines which are preferentially found on the same side of alpha-helices.},

@article{Dunlop2010,
abstract = {Immunologically, "self" carbohydrates protect the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein, gp120, from antibody recognition. However, one broadly neutralizing antibody, 2G12, neutralizes primary viral isolates by direct recognition of Manalpha1--{\textgreater}2Man motifs formed by the host-derived oligomannose glycans of the viral envelope. Immunogens, capable of eliciting antibodies of similar specificity to 2G12, are therefore candidates for HIV/AIDS vaccine development. In this context, it is known that the yeast mannan polysaccharides exhibit significant antigenic mimicry with the glycans of HIV-1. Here, we report that modulation of yeast polysaccharide biosynthesis directly controls the molecular specificity of cross-reactive antibodies to self oligomannose glycans. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannans are typically terminated by alpha1--{\textgreater}3-linked mannoses that cap a Manalpha1--{\textgreater}2Man motif that otherwise closely resembles the part of the oligomannose epitope recognized by 2G12. Immunization with S. cerevisiae deficient for the alpha1--{\textgreater}3 mannosyltransferase gene (DeltaMnn1), but not with wild-type S. cerevisiae, reproducibly elicited antibodies to the self oligomannose glycans. Carbohydrate microarray analysis of DeltaMnn1 immune sera revealed fine carbohydrate specificity to Manalpha1--{\textgreater}2Man units, closely matching that of 2G12. These specificities were further corroborated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with chemically defined glycoforms of gp120. These antibodies exhibited remarkable similarity in the carbohydrate specificity to 2G12 and displayed statistically significant, albeit extremely weak, neutralization of HIV-1 compared to control immune sera. These data confirm the Manalpha1--{\textgreater}2Man motif as the primary carbohydrate neutralization determinant of HIV-1 and show that the genetic modulation of microbial polysaccharides is a route towards immunogens capable of eliciting antibody responses to the glycans of HIV-1.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND With the developments of DNA sequencing technology, large amounts of sequencing data have become available in recent years and provide unprecedented opportunities for advanced association studies between somatic point mutations and cancer types/subtypes, which may contribute to more accurate somatic point mutation based cancer classification (SMCC). However in existing SMCC methods, issues like high data sparsity, small volume of sample size, and the application of simple linear classifiers, are major obstacles in improving the classification performance. RESULTS To address the obstacles in existing SMCC studies, we propose DeepGene, an advanced deep neural network (DNN) based classifier, that consists of three steps: firstly, the clustered gene filtering (CGF) concentrates the gene data by mutation occurrence frequency, filtering out the majority of irrelevant genes; secondly, the indexed sparsity reduction (ISR) converts the gene data into indexes of its non-zero elements, thereby significantly suppressing the impact of data sparsity; finally, the data after CGF and ISR is fed into a DNN classifier, which extracts high-level features for accurate classification. Experimental results on our curated TCGA-DeepGene dataset, which is a reformulated subset of the TCGA dataset containing 12 selected types of cancer, show that CGF, ISR and DNN all contribute in improving the overall classification performance. We further compare DeepGene with three widely adopted classifiers and demonstrate that DeepGene has at least 24{\%} performance improvement in terms of testing accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Based on deep learning and somatic point mutation data, we devise DeepGene, an advanced cancer type classifier, which addresses the obstacles in existing SMCC studies. Experiments indicate that DeepGene outperforms three widely adopted existing classifiers, which is mainly attributed to its deep learning module that is able to extract the high level features between combinatorial somatic point mutations and cancer types.},

abstract = {Bacteriophages typically have small genomes1 and depend on their bacterial hosts for replication2. Here we sequenced DNA from diverse ecosystems and found hundreds of phage genomes with lengths of more than 200 kilobases (kb), including a genome of 735 kb, which is—to our knowledge—the largest phage genome to be described to date. Thirty-five genomes were manually curated to completion (circular and no gaps). Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and previously undescribed CRISPR–Cas systems, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modification enzymes, translation-initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. The CRISPR–Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In addition, some phages may repurpose bacterial CRISPR–Cas systems to eliminate competing phages. We phylogenetically define the major clades of huge phages from human and other animal microbiomes, as well as from oceans, lakes, sediments, soils and the built environment. We conclude that the large gene inventories of huge phages reflect a conserved biological strategy, and that the phages are distributed across a broad bacterial host range and across Earth's ecosystems.},

MMR proteins also participate in many other DNA transactions, such that inactivation of MMR can have wide-ranging biological consequences, which can be either beneficial or detrimental. We begin this review by briefly considering the multiple functions of MMR proteins and the consequences of impaired function. We then focus on the biochemical mechanism of MMR replication errors.

abstract = {Catalysis of glutamate transport across cell membranes and coupling of the concentrative transport to sodium, proton, and potassium gradients are processes fundamental to organisms in all kingdoms of life. In bacteria, glutamate transporters participate in nutrient uptake, while in eukaryotic organisms, the transporters clear glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Even though glutamate transporters are crucial to the viability of many life forms, little is known about their structure and quaternary organization. In particular, the subunit stoichiometry of these polytopic integral membrane proteins has not been unequivocally defined. Determination of the native molecular mass of membrane proteins is complicated by their lability in detergent micelles and by their association with detergent and/or lipid molecules. Here we report the purification of glutamate transporters from Bacillus caldotenax and Bacillus stearothermophilus in a monodisperse, detergent-solubilized state. Characterization of both transporters either by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry or by size-exclusion chromatography and in-line laser light scattering, refractive index, and ultraviolet absorption measurements shows that the transporters have a trimeric quaternary structure. Limited proteolysis further defines regions of primary structure that are exposed to aqueous solution. Together, our results define the subunit stoichiometry of high-affinity glutamate transporters from B. caldotenax and B. stearothermophilus and localize exposed and accessible elements of primary structure. Because of the close amino acid sequence relationship between bacterial and eukaryotic transporters, our results are germane to prokaryotic and eukaryotic glutamate and neutral amino acid transporters.},

abstract = {Evolution of eukaryotes is mediated by sexual recombination of parental genomes. Crossovers occur in random, but homologous, positions at a frequency that depends on DNA length. As exons occupy only 1{\%} of the human genome and introns about 24{\%}, by far most of the crossovers occur between exons, rather than inside. The natural process of creating new combinations of exons by intronic recombination is called exon shuffling. Our group is developing in vitro formats for exon shuffling and applying these to the directed evolution of proteins. Based on the splice frame junctions, nine classes of exons and three classes of introns can be distinguished. Splice frame diagrams of natural genes show how the splice frame rules govern exon shuffling. Here, we review various approaches to constructing libraries of exon-shuffled genes. For example, exon shuffling of human pharmaceutical proteins can generate libraries in which all of the sequences are fully human, without the point mutations that raise concerns about immunogenicity.},

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying risk factors remain largely unclear for this heterogeneous disorder. In recent years, high throughput methodologies, such as genome-wide linkage analysis (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA) studies, and genome-wide expression profiling (GWE), have led to the identification of several candidate genes associated with AD. However, due to lack of consistency within their findings, an integrative approach is warranted. Here, we have designed a rank based gene prioritization approach involving convergent analysis of multi-dimensional data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network modelling.Results: Our approach employs integration of three different AD datasets- GWL,GWA and GWE to identify overlapping candidate genes ranked using a novel cumulative rank score (SR) based method followed by prioritization using clusters derived from PPI network. SR for each gene is calculated by addition of rank assigned to individual gene based on either p value or score in three datasets. This analysis yielded 108 plausible AD genes. Network modelling by creating PPI using proteins encoded by these genes and their direct interactors resulted in a layered network of 640 proteins. Clustering of these proteins further helped us in identifying 6 significant clusters with 7 proteins (EGFR, ACTB, CDC2, IRAK1, APOE, ABCA1 and AMPH) forming the central hub nodes. Functional annotation of 108 genes revealed their role in several biological activities such as neurogenesis, regulation of MAP kinase activity, response to calcium ion, endocytosis paralleling the AD specific attributes. Finally, 3 potential biochemical biomarkers were found from the overlap of 108 AD proteins with proteins from CSF and plasma proteome. EGFR and ACTB were found to be the two most significant AD risk genes.Conclusions: With the assumption that common genetic signals obtained from different methodological platforms might serve as robust AD risk markers than candidates identified using single dimension approach, here we demonstrated an integrated genomic convergence approach for disease candidate gene prioritization from heterogeneous data sources linked to AD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Talwar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors mediate rapid transmission throughout the nervous system by converting a chemical signal into an electric one. They are pentameric proteins with an extracellular domain that carries the transmitter binding sites and a transmembrane region that forms the ion pore. Their essential function is to couple the binding of the agonist at the extracellular domain to the opening of the ion pore. How the structural changes elicited by agonist binding are propagated through a distance of 50 A to the gate is therefore central for the understanding of the receptor function. A step forward toward the identification of the structures involved in gating has been given by the recently elucidated high-resolution structures of Cys-loop receptors and related proteins. The extracellular-transmembrane interface has attracted attention because it is a structural transition zone where beta-sheets from the extracellular domain merge with alpha-helices from the transmembrane domain. Within this zone, several regions form a network that relays structural changes from the binding site toward the pore, and therefore, this interface controls the beginning and duration of a synaptic response. In this review, the most recent findings on residues and pairwise interactions underlying channel gating are discussed, the main focus being on the extracellular-transmembrane interface.},

This approach allows us to resolve the relative distance between the motor domains and their relative orientation, on the submillisecond timescale, during processive stepping. We observe transitions between high and low FRET values for certain kinesin constructs, depending on the location of the labels. These results reveal that, during a step, a kinesin motor domain dwells in a well-defined intermediate position for approximately 3 ms.},

This bidirectional signaling is mediated by the short cytoplasmic tails of the two integrin subunits.

abstract = {The $\alpha$-pore-forming toxin Cytolysin A (ClyA) is responsible for the hemolytic phenotype of several Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica strains. ClyA is a soluble, 34 kDa monomer that assembles into a dodecameric pore complex in the presence of membranes or detergent. The comparison of the X-ray structures of monomeric ClyA and the ClyA protomer in the pore complex revealed one of the largest conformational transitions observed so far in proteins, involving the structural rearrangement of more than half of all residues, which is consistent with the finding that conversion from the monomer to the assembly competent protomer is rate-limiting for pore assembly. Here, we introduced artificial disulfide bonds at two distinct sites into the ClyA monomer that both prevent a specific structural rearrangement required for protomer formation. Using electron microscopy and hemolytic activity assays, we show that the engineered disulfides indeed trap these ClyA variants in an assembly incompetent state. Assembly of the variants into functional pore complexes can be completely recovered by disulfide reduction. The assembly kinetics of the ClyA variants recorded with circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the same mechanism of protomer formation that was observed for wild-type ClyA, proceeding via an intermediate with decreased secondary structure content.},

However, precisely how lipoproteins affect tissue lipid composition has not been comprehensively analyzed. Here, we identify the major lipoproteins of Drosophila melanogaster and use genetics and mass spectrometry to study their assembly, interorgan trafficking, and influence on tissue lipids. The apoB-family lipoprotein Lipophorin (Lpp) is the major hemolymph lipid carrier. It is produced as a phospholipid-rich particle by the fat body, and its secretion requires Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTP). Lpp acquires sterols and most diacylglycerol (DAG) at the gut via Lipid Transfer Particle (LTP), another fat body-derived apoB-family lipoprotein. The gut, like the fat body, is a lipogenic organ, incorporating both de novo-synthesized and dietary fatty acids into DAG for export. We identify distinct requirements for LTP and Lpp-dependent lipid mobilization in contributing to the neutral and polar lipid composition of the brain and wing imaginal disc. These studies define major routes of interorgan lipid transport in Drosophila and uncover surprising tissue-specific differences in lipoprotein lipid utilization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Palm et al.},

Both deposits are known to include peptides that contain a common sequence. Both forms of amyloid were isolated and their peptide compositions were determined. The peptides were resolved by size-exclusion chromatography in 70{\%} formic acid, and reverse-phase chromatography in 60{\%} formic acid, 0-40{\%} acetonitrile. Senile plaque amyloid cores contain about 25{\%} protein, about 70{\%} of which is composed of peptides containing the beta-amyloid sequence. Amino-terminal sequencing of the core amyloid peptides (CAPs) revealed extensive amino-terminal heterogeneity, with variable amounts of blocked amino termini. Matrix-assisted, laser-desorption-time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the CAP mixture revealed an array of peptides the molecular weights of which corresponded to peptides beginning with each of the first 11 amino acids of the beta-peptide sequence and ending with Ala-42 of that sequence. The carboxyl-terminal residues were identified by tandem mass spectrometry of chymotrypsin digests. CAP possessed a minor degree of carboxyl-terminal heterogeneity. Cerebrovascular amyloid peptides (CVAPs) possessed minor degrees of both amino- and carboxyl-terminal heterogeneity. The major CVAP commenced at Asp-1 and ended at Val-40. Minor components of CAP possessed masses of 8000-9000 Da and the same amino-terminal residues as the major components of CAP. They may be precursors to the smaller CAPs. The differences in amino termini and carboxyl termini of CAPs and CVAPs suggest that the two types of amyloid form by different pathways, on which they encounter different proteases.},

Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms.

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

The closed channel has an empty cytoplasmic funnel and an extracellular funnel that is filled with a small helical domain, called the plug. During initiation of translocation, a ribosome-nascent chain complex binds to the SecY (or Sec61) complex, resulting in insertion of the nascent chain. However, the mechanism of channel opening during translocation is unclear. Here we have addressed this question by determining structures of inactive and active ribosome-channel complexes with cryo-electron microscopy. Non-translating ribosome-SecY channel complexes derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii or Escherichia coli show the channel in its closed state, and indicate that ribosome binding per se causes only minor changes. The structure of an active E. coli ribosome-channel complex demonstrates that the nascent chain opens the channel, causing mostly rigid body movements of the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of SecY. In this early translocation intermediate, the polypeptide inserts as a loop into the SecY channel with the hydrophobic signal sequence intercalated into the open lateral gate. The nascent chain also forms a loop on the cytoplasmic surface of SecY rather than entering the channel directly.},

Here we report that C. elegans FANCD2 (fcd-2) is dispensable for normal meiotic recombination but is required in crossover defective mutants to prevent illegitimate repair of meiotic breaks by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). In mitotic cells, we show that DNA repair defects of C. elegans fcd-2 mutants and FA-deficient human cells are significantly suppressed by eliminating NHEJ. Moreover, NHEJ factors are inappropriately recruited to sites of replication stress in the absence of FANCD2. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that FA results from the promiscuous action of NHEJ during DNA repair. We propose that a critical function of the FA pathway is to channel lesions into accurate, as opposed to error-prone, repair pathways.},

abstract = {Infection by Staphylococcus aureus can result in severe conditions such as septicemia, toxic shock, pneumonia, and endocarditis with antibiotic resistance and persistent nasal carriage in normal individuals being key drivers of the medical impact of this virulent pathogen. In both virulent infection and nasal colonization, S. aureus encounters the host immune system and produces a wide array of factors that frustrate host immunity. One in particular, the prototypical staphylococcal superantigen-like protein SSL7, potently binds IgA and C5, thereby inhibiting immune responses dependent on these major immune mediators. We report here the three-dimensional structure of the complex of SSL7 with Fc of human IgA1 at 3.2 {\AA} resolution. Two SSL7 molecules interact with the Fc (one per heavy chain) primarily at the junction between the C$\alpha$2 and C$\alpha$3 domains. The binding site on each IgA chain is extensive, with SSL7 shielding most of the lateral surface of the C$\alpha$3 domain. However, the SSL7 molecules are positioned such that they should allow binding to secretory IgA. The key IgA residues interacting with SSL7 are also bound by the leukocyte IgA receptor, Fc$\alpha$RI (CD89), thereby explaining how SSL7 potently inhibits IgA-dependent cellular effector functions mediated by Fc$\alpha$RI, such as phagocytosis, degranulation, and respiratory burst. Thus, the ability of S. aureus to subvert IgA-mediated immunity is likely to facilitate survival in mucosal environments such as the nasal passage and may contribute to systemic infections. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Besides fundamental limits imposed by radiation damage, poor detectors and beam-induced sample movement have been shown to degrade attainable resolutions. A new generation of direct electron detectors may ameliorate both effects. Apart from exhibiting improved signal-to-noise performance, these cameras are also fast enough to follow particle movements during electron irradiation. Here, we assess the potentials of this technology for cryo-EM structure determination. Using a newly developed statistical movie processing approach to compensate for beam-induced movement, we show that ribosome reconstructions with unprecedented resolutions may be calculated from almost two orders of magnitude fewer particles than used previously. Therefore, this methodology may expand the scope of high-resolution cryo-EM to a broad range of biological specimens.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00461.001.},

abstract = {We show how to learn a deep graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (e.g. 32), the graphical model performs "semantic hashing": Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to filter the documents given to TF-IDF, we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire document set. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Genetic studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have defined a variety of single-gene mutations that have specific effects on programmed cell death. Analyses of the genes defined by these mutations have revealed that cell death is an active process that requires gene function in cells that die. Specific genes are required not only to cause cell death but also to protect cells from dying. Gene interaction studies have defined a genetic pathway for the execution phase of programmed cell death in C. elegans. Molecular and biochemical findings are consistent with the pathway proposed from these genetic studies and have also revealed that the protein products of certain cell-death genes interact directly. This pathway appears to be conserved among organisms as diverse as nematodes and humans. Important questions remain to be answered about programmed cell death in C. elegans. For example, how does a cell decide to die? How is cell death initiated? What are the mechanisms of action of the cell-death protector and killer genes? What genes lie downstream of the cell-death execution pathway? The conservation of the central cell-death pathway suggests that additional genetic analyses of programmed cell death in C. elegans will help answer these questions, not only for this nematode but also for other organisms, including ourselves.},

abstract = {Ocean plastic can persist in sea surface waters, eventually accumulating in remote areas of the world's oceans. Here we characterise and quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted at least 79 (45-129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million km2; a figure four to sixteen times higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5 cm and at least 46{\%} was comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8{\%} of the total mass but 94{\%} of the estimated 1.8 (1.1-3.6) trillion pieces floating in the area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP. Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.},

The rare premature aging Werner's syndrome (WS) provides a phenocopy of normal human aging and WS patient cells recapitulate the aging phenotype in culture as they rapidly lose the ability to proliferate or replicate their DNA. WS is associated with loss of functional WRN protein. Although the biochemical properties of WRN protein, which possesses both helicase and exonuclease activities, suggest an involvement in DNA metabolism, its action in cells is not clear. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a role of the WRN protein in DNA replication in normally proliferating cells. Most importantly, we demonstrate that in the absence of functional WRN protein, replication forks from origins of bidirectional replication fail to progress normally, resulting in marked asymmetry of bidirectional forks. We propose that WRN acts in normal DNA replication to prevent collapse of replication forks or to resolve DNA junctions at stalled replication forks, and that loss of this capacity may be a contributory factor in premature aging},

Tumor cells treated with the same antibody and injected into nude mice had significantly reduced number and size of tumors in nude mice. The tissue distribution of other integrins was also normalized, suggesting the existence of intimate interactions between the different integrin pathways as well as adherens junctions. On the other hand, nonmalignant cells when treated with either {\{}alpha{\}}6 or {\{}beta{\}}4 function altering antibodies continued to grow, and had disorganized colony morphologies resembling the untreated tumor colonies. This shows a significant role of the {\{}alpha{\}}6/{\{}beta{\}}4 heterodimer in directing polarity and tissue structure.

Among these, the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of proteoglycans shape Hh gradients and signal transduction. We have determined crystal structures of Sonic Hh complexes with two GAGs, heparin and chondroitin sulfate. The interaction determinants, confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and binding studies, reveal a previously not identified Hh site for GAG binding, common to all Hh proteins. The majority of Hh residues forming this GAG-binding site have been previously implicated in developmental diseases. Crystal packing analysis, combined with analytical ultracentrifugation of Sonic Hh-GAG complexes, suggests a potential mechanism for GAG-dependent Hh multimerization. Taken together, these results provide a direct mechanistic explanation of the observed correlation between disease and impaired Hh gradient formation. Moreover, GAG binding partially overlaps with the site of Hh interactions with an array of protein partners including Patched, hedgehog interacting protein, and the interference hedgehog protein family, suggesting a unique mechanism of Hh signaling modulation.},

Crystal structures of Fab 2G12 and its complexes with the disaccharide Manalpha1-2Man and with the oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc2 revealed that two Fabs assemble into an interlocked VH domain-swapped dimer. Further biochemical, biophysical, and mutagenesis data strongly support a Fab-dimerized antibody as the prevalent form that recognizes gp120. The extraordinary configuration of this antibody provides an extended surface, with newly described binding sites, for multivalent interaction with a conserved cluster of oligomannose type sugars on the surface of gp120. The unique interdigitation of Fab domains within an antibody uncovers a previously unappreciated mechanism for high-affinity recognition of carbohydrate or other repeating epitopes on cell or microbial surfaces.},

MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their enriched annotations.},

We developed a highly sensitive single muscle fiber proteomics workflow to study human aging and show that the senescence of slow and fast muscle fibers is characterized by diverging metabolic and protein quality control adaptations. Whereas mitochondrial content declines with aging in both fiber types, glycolysis and glycogen metabolism are upregulated in slow but downregulated in fast muscle fibers. Aging mitochondria decrease expression of the redox enzyme monoamine oxidase A. Slow fibers upregulate a subset of actin and myosin chaperones, whereas an opposite change happens in fast fibers. These changes in metabolism and sarcomere quality control may be related to the ability of slow, but not fast, muscle fibers to maintain their mass during aging. We conclude that single muscle fiber analysis by proteomics can elucidate pathophysiology in a sub-type-specific manner.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that has no known cure, nor is there a clear mechanistic understanding of the disease process itself. Although amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline are late-stage markers of the disease, it is unclear how they are initially generated, and if they represent a cause, effect, or end phase in the pathology process. Recent studies in AD models have identified marked dysregulations in calcium signaling and related downstream pathways, which occur long before the diagnostic histopathological or cognitive changes. Under normal conditions, intracellular calcium signals are coupled to effectors that maintain a healthy physiological state. Consequently, sustained up-regulation of calcium may have pathophysiological consequences. Indeed, upon reviewing the current body of literature, increased calcium levels are functionally linked to the major features and risk factors of AD: ApoE4 expression, presenilin and APP mutations, beta amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau, apoptosis, and synaptic dysfunction. In turn, the histopathological features of AD, once formed, are capable of further increasing calcium levels, leading to a rapid feed-forward acceleration once the disease process has taken hold. The views proposed here consider that AD pathogenesis reflects long-term calcium dysregulations that ultimately serve an enabling role in the disease process. Therefore, "Calcinists" do not necessarily reject betaAptist or Tauist doctrine, but rather believe that their genesis is associated with earlier calcium signaling dysregulations.},

This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Motivation: Within a homologous protein family, proteins may be grouped into subtypes that share specific functions that are not common to the entire family. Often, the amino acids present in a small number of sequence positions determine each protein's particular function-al specificity. Knowledge of these specificity determining positions (SDPs) aids in protein function prediction, drug design and experimental analysis. A number of sequence-based computational methods have been introduced for identifying SDPs; however, their further development and evaluation have been hindered by the limited number of known experimentally determined SDPs. Results: We combine several bioinformatics resources to automate a process, typically undertaken manually, to build a dataset of SDPs. The resulting large dataset, which consists of SDPs in enzymes, enables us to characterize SDPs in terms of their physicochemical and evolution-ary properties. It also facilitates the large-scale evaluation of sequence-based SDP prediction methods. We present a simple sequence-based SDP prediction method, GroupSim, and show that, surprisingly, it is competitive with a representative set of current methods. We also describe ConsWin, a heuristic that considers sequence conservation of neighboring amino acids, and demonstrate that it improves the performance of all methods tested on our large dataset of enzyme SDPs. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

APA contributes to the complexity of the transcriptome by generating isoforms that differ either in their coding sequence or in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), thereby potentially regulating the function, stability, localization and translation efficiency of target RNAs.

abstract = {Genome-wide studies of aging have identified subsets of genes that show age-related changes in expression. Although the types of genes that are age-regulated vary among different tissues and organisms, some patterns emerge from these large data sets. First, aging is associated with a broad induction of stress response pathways, although the specific genes and pathways involved differ depending on cell type and species. In contrast, a wide variety of functional classes of genes are downregulated with age, often including tissue-specific genes. Whereas the upregulation of age-regulated genes is likely to be governed by stress-responsive transcription factors, questions remain as to why particular genes are susceptible to age-related transcriptional decline. Here, we discuss recent findings showing that splicing is misregulated with age. While defects in splicing could lead to changes in protein isoform levels, they could also impact gene expression through nonsense-mediated decay of intron-retained transcripts. The discovery that splicing is misregulated with age suggests that other aspects of gene expression, such as transcription elongation, termination and polyadenylation, must also be considered as potential mechanisms for age-related changes in transcript levels. Moreover, the considerable variation between genome-wide aging expression studies indicates that there is a critical need to analyze the transcriptional signatures of aging in single cell types rather than whole tissues. Since age-associated decreases in gene expression could contribute to a progressive decline in cellular function, understanding the mechanisms that determine the aging transcriptome provides a potential target to extend healthy cellular lifespan.},

abstract = {During plant photosynthesis, photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII), located in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast, use light energy to mobilize electron transport. Different modes of electron flow exist. Linear electron flow is driven by both photosystems and generates ATP and NADPH, whereas cyclic electron flow (CEF) is driven by PSI alone and generates ATP only. Two variants of CEF exist in flowering plants, of which one is sensitive to antimycin A (AA) and involves the two thylakoid proteins, PGR5 and PGRL1. However, neither the mechanism nor the site of reinjection of electrons from ferredoxin into the thylakoid electron transport chain during AA-sensitive CEF is known. Here, we show that PGRL1 accepts electrons from ferredoxin in a PGR5-dependent manner and reduces quinones in an AA-sensitive fashion. PGRL1 activity itself requires several redox-active cysteine residues and a Fe-containing cofactor. We therefore propose that PGRL1 is the elusive ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase (FQR).},

In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. We showed previously that RNF8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at DSBs. Here, we provide evidence that, while RNF8 is necessary to trigger the DSB-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. We identified RNF168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. We show that RNF168 interacts with ubiquitylated H2A, assembles at DSBs in an RNF8-dependent manner, and, by targeting H2A and H2AX, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, RNF168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between E3 ligases in genome maintenance.},

abstract = {Autoimmune diseases are prevalent and often life-threatening syndromes, yet the pathogenic triggers and mechanisms involved remain mostly unresolved. Protein asparagine linked- (N-) glycosylation produces glycan structures that substantially differ among the extracellular compartments of evolutionarily divergent organisms. Alpha-mannosidase-II (alphaM-II) deficiency diminishes complex-type N-glycan branching in vertebrates and induces an autoimmune disease in mice similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus. We found that disease pathogenesis provoking glomerulonephritis and kidney failure was nonhematopoietic in origin, independent of complement C3 and the adaptive immune system, mitigated by intravenous administration of immunoglobulin-G, and linked to chronic activation of the innate immune system. N-glycans produced in alphaM-II deficiency bear immune-stimulatory mannose-dependent ligands for innate immune lectin receptors, disrupting the phylogenic basis of this glycomic recognition mechanism. Thus, mammalian N-glycan branching safeguards against the formation of an endogenous immunologic signal of nonself that can provoke a sterile inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, the humoral response characterised by the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the fat body (the equivalent of the mammalian liver) and the cellular response mediated by haemocytes (blood cells) engaged in phagocytosis represent two major reactions that counter pathogens. Although considerable analysis has permitted the elucidation of mechanisms pertaining to the two responses individually, the mechanism of their coordination has been unclear. To characterise the signals with which infection might be communicated between blood cells and fat body, we ablated circulating haemocytes and defined the parameters of AMP gene activation in larvae. We found that targeted ablation of blood cells influenced the levels of AMP gene expression in the fat body following both septic injury and oral infection. Expression of the AMP gene drosomycin (a Toll target) was blocked when expression of the Toll ligand Sp{\"{a}}tzle was knocked down in haemocytes. These results show that in larvae, integration of the two responses in a systemic reaction depend on the production of a cytokine (spz), a process that strongly parallels the mammalian immune response.},

abstract = {TolB and Pal are members of the Tol-Pal system that spans the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and contributes to the stability and integrity of the bacterial outer membrane (OM). Lipoylated Pal is tethered to the OM and binds the $\beta$-propeller domain of periplasmic TolB, which, as recent evidence suggests, disengages TolB from its interaction with other components of the Tol system in the inner membrane. Antibacterial nuclease colicins such as colicin E9 (ColE9) also bind the $\beta$-propeller domain of TolB in order to catalyze their translocation across the bacterial OM. In contrast to Pal, however, colicin binding to TolB promotes its interaction with other components of the Tol system. Here, through a series of pre-steady-state kinetic experiments utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer pairs within the individual protein-protein complexes, we establish the kinetic basis for such 'competitive recruitment' by the TolB-binding epitope (TBE) of ColE9. Surprisingly, the 16-residue disordered ColE9 TBE associates more rapidly with TolB than Pal, a folded 13-kDa protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that calcium ions, which bind within the confines of the TolB $\beta$-propeller domain tunnel and are known to increase the affinity of the TolB-ColE9 complex, do not exert their influence through long-range electrostatic effects, as had been predicted, but through short-range effects that slow the dissociation rate of ColE9 TBE from its complex with TolB. Our study demonstrates that an intrinsically disordered protein undergoing binding-induced folding can compete effectively with a globular protein for a common target by associating more rapidly than the globular protein.},

abstract = {As of April 2018, UniProtKB has collected more than 115 million protein sequences. Less than 0.15{\%} of these proteins, however, have been associated with experimental GO annotations. As such, the use of automatic protein function prediction (AFP) to reduce this huge gap becomes increasingly important. The previous studies conclude that sequence homology based methods are highly effective in AFP. In addition, mining motif, domain, and functional information from protein sequences has been found very helpful for AFP. Other than sequences, alternative information sources such as text, however, may be useful for AFP as well. Instead of using BOW (bag of words) representation in traditional text-based AFP, we propose a new method called DeepText2GO that relies on deep semantic text representation, together with different kinds of available protein information such as sequence homology, families, domains, and motifs, to improve large-scale AFP. Furthermore, DeepText2GO integrates text-based methods with sequence-based ones by means of a consensus approach. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset extracted from UniProt/SwissProt have demonstrated that DeepText2GO significantly outperformed both text-based and sequence-based methods, validating its superiority.},

Whether sirtuins can reverse aging-associated degeneration is unknown. Tissue-specific stem cells persist throughout the entire lifespan to repair and maintain tissues, but their self-renewal and differentiation potential become dysregulated with aging. We show that SIRT3, a mammalian sirtuin that regulates the global acetylation landscape of mitochondrial proteins and reduces oxidative stress, is highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) where it regulates a stress response. SIRT3 is dispensable for HSC maintenance and tissue homeostasis at a young age under homeostatic conditions but is essential under stress or at an old age. Importantly, SIRT3 is suppressed with aging, and SIRT3 upregulation in aged HSCs improves their regenerative capacity. Our study illuminates the plasticity of mitochondrial homeostasis controlling stem cell and tissue maintenance during the aging process and shows that aging-associated degeneration can be reversed by a sirtuin.},

abstract = {Folding and function may impose different requirements on the amino acid sequences of proteins, thus potentially giving rise to conflict. Such a conflict, or frustration, can result in the formation of partially misfolded intermediates that can compromise folding and promote aggregation. We investigate this phenomenon by studying frataxin, a protein whose normal function is to facilitate the formation of iron-sulfur clusters but whose mutations are associated with Friedreich's ataxia. To characterize the folding pathway of this protein we carry out a $\Phi$-value analysis and use the resulting structural information to determine the structure of the folding transition state, which we then validate by a second round of rationally designed mutagenesis. The analysis of the transition-state structure reveals that the regions involved in the folding process are highly aggregation-prone. By contrast, the regions that are functionally important are partially misfolded in the transition state but highly resistant to aggregation. Taken together, these results indicate that in frataxin the competition between folding and function creates the possibility of misfolding, and that to prevent aggregation the amino acid sequence of this protein is optimized to be highly resistant to aggregation in the regions involved in misfolding.},

Determination of the structures of Na(v) channels will shed light on ion channel mechanisms and facilitate potential clinical applications. A family of bacterial Na(v) channels, exemplified by the Na(+)-selective channel of bacteria (NaChBac), provides a useful model system for structure-function analysis. Here we report the crystal structure of Na(v)Rh, a NaChBac orthologue from the marine alphaproteobacterium HIMB114 (Rickettsiales sp. HIMB114; denoted Rh), at 3.05 {\AA} resolution. The channel comprises an asymmetric tetramer. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of Thr 178 and Leu 179 constitute an inner site within the selectivity filter where a hydrated Ca(2+) resides in the crystal structure. The outer mouth of the Na(+) selectivity filter, defined by Ser 181 and Glu 183, is closed, as is the activation gate at the intracellular side of the pore. The voltage sensors adopt a depolarized conformation in which all the gating charges are exposed to the extracellular environment. We propose that Na(v)Rh is in an 'inactivated' conformation. Comparison of Na(v)Rh with Na(v)Ab reveals considerable conformational rearrangements that may underlie the electromechanical coupling mechanism of voltage-gated channels.},

abstract = {Ascent to high altitude is associated with a fall in the partial pressure of inspired oxygen (hypobaric hypoxia). For oxidative tissues such as skeletal muscle, resultant cellular hypoxia necessitates acclimatization to optimize energy metabolism and restrict oxidative stress, with changes in gene and protein expression that alter mitochondrial function. It is known that lowlanders returning from high altitude have decreased muscle mitochondrial densities, yet the underlying transcriptional mechanisms and time course are poorly understood. To explore these, we measured gene and protein expression plus ultrastructure in muscle biopsies of lowlanders at sea level and following exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. Subacute exposure (19 d after initiating ascent to Everest base camp, 5300 m) was not associated with mitochondrial loss. After 66 d at altitude and ascent beyond 6400 m, mitochondrial densities fell by 21{\%}, with loss of 73{\%} of subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Correspondingly, levels of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1$\alpha$ fell by 35{\%}, suggesting down-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Sustained hypoxia also decreased expression of electron transport chain complexes I and IV and UCP3 levels. We suggest that during subacute hypoxia, mitochondria might be protected from oxidative stress. However, following sustained exposure, mitochondrial biogenesis is deactivated and uncoupling down-regulated, perhaps to improve the efficiency of ATP production.-Levett, D. Z., Radford, E.

abstract = {The topological landscape of molecular or functional interaction networks provides a rich source of information for inferring functional patterns of genes or proteins. However, a pressing yet-unsolved challenge is how to combine multiple heterogeneous networks, each having different connectivity patterns, to achieve more accurate inference. Here, we describe the Mashup framework for scalable and robust network integration. In Mashup, the diffusion in each network is first analyzed to characterize the topological context of each node. Next, the high-dimensional topological patterns in individual networks are canonically represented using low-dimensional vectors, one per gene or protein. These vectors can then be plugged into off-the-shelf machine learning methods to derive functional insights about genes or proteins. We present tools based on Mashup that achieve state-of-the-art performance in three diverse functional inference tasks: protein function prediction, gene ontology reconstruction, and genetic interaction prediction. Mashup enables deeper insights into the structure of rapidly accumulating and diverse biological network data and can be broadly applied to other network science domains.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clustering protein sequences according to inferred homology is a fundamental step in the analysis of many large data sets. Since the publication of the Markov Clustering (MCL) algorithm in 2002, it has been the centerpiece of several popular applications. Each of these approaches generates an undirected graph that represents sequences as nodes connected to each other by edges weighted with a BLAST-based metric. MCL is then used to infer clusters of homologous proteins by analyzing these graphs. The various approaches differ only by how they weight the edges, yet there has been very little direct examination of the relative performance of alternative edge-weighting metrics. This study compares the performance of four BLAST-based edge-weighting metrics: the bit score, bit score ratio (BSR), bit score over anchored length (BAL), and negative common log of the expectation value (NLE). Performance is tested using the Extended CEGMA KOGs (ECK) database, which we introduce here.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All metrics performed similarly when analyzing full-length sequences, but dramatic differences emerged as progressively larger fractions of the test sequences were split into fragments. The BSR and BAL successfully rescued subsets of clusters by strengthening certain types of alignments between fragmented sequences, but also shifted the largest correct scores down near the range of scores generated from spurious alignments. This penalty outweighed the benefits in most test cases, and was greatly exacerbated by increasing the MCL inflation parameter, making these metrics less robust than the bit score or the more popular NLE. Notably, the bit score performed as well or better than the other three metrics in all scenarios.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results provide a strong case for use of the bit score, which appears to offer equivalent or superior performance to the more popular NLE. The insight that MCL-based clustering methods can be improved using a more tractable edge-weighting metric will greatly simplify future implementations. We demonstrate this with our own minimalist Python implementation: Porthos, which uses only standard libraries and can process a graph with 25 m + edges connecting the 60 k + KOG sequences in half a minute using less than half a gigabyte of memory.},

abstract = {Background: Predicting protein complexes from protein-protein interaction data is becoming a fundamental problem in computational biology. The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditions. On the other hand, large datasets of experimentally detected protein-protein interactions were determined using High-throughput experimental techniques. However, experimental data is usually liable to contain a large number of spurious interactions. Therefore, it is essential to validate these interactions before exploiting them to predict protein complexes.Results: In this paper, we propose a novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes. Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methods. PEWCC was able to detect more matched complexes than any of the state-of-the-art methods with higher quality scores.Conclusions: The higher accuracy achieved by PEWCC in detecting protein complexes is a valid argument in favor of the proposed method.

abstract = {INTRODUCTIONGenetic interactions occur when mutations in two or more genes combine to generate an unexpected phenotype. An extreme negative or synthetic lethal genetic interaction occurs when two mutations, neither lethal individually, combine to cause cell death. Conversely, positive genetic interactions occur when two mutations produce a phenotype that is less severe than expected. Genetic interactions identify functional relationships between genes and can be harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification. They may also explain a considerable component of the undiscovered genetics associated with human diseases. Here, we describe construction and analysis of a comprehensive genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell.RATIONALEGenome sequencing projects are providing an unprecedented view of genetic variation. However, our ability to interpret genetic information to predict inherited phenotypes remains limited, in large part due to the extensive buffering of genomes, making most individual eukaryotic genes dispensable for life. To explore the extent to which genetic interactions reveal cellular function and contribute to complex phenotypes, and to discover the general principles of genetic networks, we used automated yeast genetics to construct a global genetic interaction network.RESULTSWe tested most of the {\~{}}6000 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for all possible pairwise genetic interactions, identifying nearly 1 million interactions, including {\~{}}550,000 negative and {\~{}}350,000 positive interactions, spanning {\~{}}90{\%} of all yeast genes. Essential genes were network hubs, displaying five times as many interactions as nonessential genes. The set of genetic interactions or the genetic interaction profile for a gene provides a quantitative measure of function, and a global network based on genetic interaction profile similarity revealed a hierarchy of modules reflecting the functional architecture of a cell. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections associated with defects in cell cycle progression or cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the global network illustrates how coherent sets of negative or positive genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathways to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.CONCLUSIONA global genetic interaction network highlights the functional organization of a cell and provides a resource for predicting gene and pathway function. This network emphasizes the prevalence of genetic interactions and their potential to compound phenotypes associated with single mutations. Negative genetic interactions tend to connect functionally related genes and thus may be predicted using alternative functional information. Although less functionally informative, positive interactions may provide insights into general mechanisms of genetic suppression or resiliency. We anticipate that the ordered topology of the global genetic network, in which genetic interactions connect coherently within and between protein complexes and pathways, may be exploited to decipher genotype-to-phenotype relationships.A global network of genetic interaction profile similarities.(Left) Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles are connected in a global network, such that genes exhibiting more similar profiles are located closer to each other, whereas genes with less similar profiles are positioned farther apart. (Right) Spatial analysis of functional enrichment was used to identify and color network regions enriched for similar Gene Ontology bioprocess terms.We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.},

abstract = {Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation is an important tool in the characterization of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution. The sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) of Lamm equation solutions is based on the approximation of a single, weight-average frictional coefficient of all particles, determined from the experimental data, which scales the diffusion coefficient to the sedimentation coefficient consistent with the traditional s approximately M(2/3) power law. It provides a high hydrodynamic resolution, where diffusional broadening of the sedimentation boundaries is deconvoluted from the sedimentation coefficient distribution. The approximation of a single weight-average frictional ratio is favored by several experimental factors, and usually gives good results for chemically not too dissimilar macromolecules, such as mixtures of folded proteins. In this communication, we examine an extension to a two-dimensional distribution of sedimentation coefficient and frictional ratio, c(s,f(r)), which is representative of a more general set of size-and-shape distributions, including mass-Stokes radius distributions, c(M,R(S)), and sedimentation coefficient-molar mass distributions c(s,M). We show that this can be used to determine average molar masses of macromolecules and characterize macromolecular distributions, without the approximation of any scaling relationship between hydrodynamic and thermodynamic parameters.},

More challenging, it also ought to outperform simple homology-based inference.Methods: Here, we describe a few methods that predict protein function exclusively through homology. Together, they set the bar or lower limit for future improvements.Results and conclusions: During the development of these methods, we faced two surprises. Firstly, our most successful implementation for the baseline ranked very high at CAFA1. In fact, our best combination of homology-based methods fared only slightly worse than the top-of-the-line prediction method from the Jones group. Secondly, although the concept of homology-based inference is simple, this work revealed that the precise details of the implementation are crucial: not only did the methods span from top to bottom performers at CAFA, but also the reasons for these differences were unexpected. In this work, we also propose a new rigorous measure to compare predicted and experimental annotations. It puts more emphasis on the details of protein function than the other measures employed by CAFA and may best reflect the expectations of users.

abstract = {Prioritizing missense variants for further experimental investigation is a key challenge in current sequencing studies for exploring complex and Mendelian diseases.

Due to the wealth of these methods, an important practical question to answer is which of these tools generalize best, that is, correctly predict the pathogenic character of new variants. We here demonstrate in a study of 10 tools on five datasets that such a comparative evaluation of these tools is hindered by two types of circularity: they arise due to (1) the same variants or (2) different variants from the same protein occurring both in the datasets used for training and for evaluation of these tools, which may lead to overly optimistic results. We show that comparative evaluations of predictors that do not address these types of circularity may erroneously conclude that circularity confounded tools are most accurate among all tools, and may even outperform optimized combinations of tools.},

abstract = {The alleles that are detrimental to health, especially in older age, are thought to persist in populations because they also confer some benefits for individuals (through antagonistic pleiotropy). The ApoE4 allele at the ApoE locus, encoding apolipoprotein E (ApoE), significantly increases risk of poor health, and yet it is present in many populations at relatively high frequencies. Why has it not been replaced by natural selection with the health-beneficial ApoE3 allele? ApoE is a major supplier of cholesterol precursor for the production of ovarian oestrogen and progesterone, thus ApoE has been suggested as the potential candidate gene that may cause variation in reproductive performance. Our results support this hypothesis showing that in 117 regularly menstruating women those with genotypes with at least one ApoE4 allele had significantly higher levels of mean luteal progesterone (144.21 pmol l-1) than women with genotypes without ApoE4 (120.49 pmol l-1), which indicates higher potential fertility. The hormonal profiles were based on daily data for entire menstrual cycles. We suggest that the finding of higher progesterone in women with ApoE4 allele could provide first strong evidence for an evolutionary mechanism of maintaining the ancestral and health-worsening ApoE4 allele in human populations.},

A domain (consisting of transmembrane segments 1-4) that moves during activation of voltage-gated channels remains stationary in TRPV1, highlighting differences in gating mechanisms for these structurally related channel superfamilies. TRPV1 opening is associated with major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism. Allosteric coupling between upper and lower gates may account for rich physiological modulation exhibited by TRPV1 and other TRP channels.},

RESULTS We have investigated 39 structural properties on a set of SNPs and disease mutations from the Uniprot Knowledge Base that could be mapped on high quality crystal structures and show that none of these properties can be used as a sole classification criterion to separate the two data sets. Furthermore, we have reviewed the annotation process from mutation to result and identified the liabilities in each step. CONCLUSION Although excellent annotation results of various research groups underline the great potential of using structural bioinformatics to investigate the mechanisms underlying disease, the interpretation of such annotations cannot always be extrapolated to proteome wide variation studies. Difficulties for large-scale studies can be found both on the technical level, i.e. the scarcity of data and the incompleteness of the structural tool suites, and on the conceptual level, i.e. the correct interpretation of the results in a cellular context.},

abstract = {The conjugation of hydrophobic cytotoxic agents such as monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to the interchain sulfhydryl groups of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) through a protease-labile linker generates a heterogeneous drug load distribution. The conjugation process can generate high-drug-load species that can affect the physical stability of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In this study, the mechanism of physical instability of ADCs was investigated by formulating the ADC pool as well as isolated drug load species in high and low ionic strength buffers to understand the effect of ionic strength on the stability of drug-conjugated Mabs. The results showed that the presence of high ionic strength buffer led to time-dependent aggregate and fragment formation of ADCs, predominantly ADCs with high-drug-load species under stress conditions. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results confirmed that there is a direct correlation between thermal unfolding and drug payload and that specific changes in the DSC thermogram profiles can be assigned to modifications by MMAE.},

Currently, only 26 of the approximately 52 identifiable major lineages, or phyla, within the domain Bacteria have cultivated representatives. Evidence from field studies indicates that many of the uncultivated phyla are found in diverse habitats, and some are extraordinarily abundant. In some important environments, including seawater, freshwater, and soil, many biologically and geochemically important organisms are at best only remotely related to any strain that has been characterized by phenotype or by genome sequencing. Genome sequence information that would allow ribosomal RNA gene trees to be related to broader patterns in microbial genome evolution is scant, and therefore microbial diversity remains largely unexplored territory.},

We studied membrane interaction of two gB ectodomain forms and present an electron cryotomography structure of the gB-bilayer complex. The two forms differed in presence or absence of the membrane proximal region (MPR) but showed an overall similar trimeric shape. The presence of the MPR impeded interaction with liposomes. In contrast, the MPR-lacking form interacted efficiently with liposomes. Lateral interaction resulted in coat formation on the membranes. The structure revealed that interaction of gB with membranes was mediated by the fusion loops and limited to the outer membrane leaflet. The observed intrinsic propensity of gB to cluster on membranes indicates an additional role of gB in driving the fusion process forward beyond the transient fusion pore opening and subsequently leading to fusion pore expansion. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Kir2 channels control the resting membrane voltage in many electrically excitable cells, and heritable mutations cause periodic paralysis and cardiac arrhythmia. We present the crystal structure of Kir2.2 from chicken, which, excluding the unstructured amino and carboxyl termini, is 90{\%} identical to human Kir2.2. Crystals containing rubidium (Rb+), strontium (Sr2+), and europium (Eu3+) reveal binding sites along the ion conduction pathway that are both conductive and inhibitory. The sites correlate with extensive electrophysiological data and provide a structural basis for understanding rectification. The channel's extracellular surface, with large structured turrets and an unusual selectivity filter entryway, might explain the relative insensitivity of eukaryotic inward rectifiers to toxins. These same surface features also suggest a possible approach to the development of inhibitory agents specific to each member of the inward-rectifier K+ channel family.},

Recent work has shown that nuclease-specific immunity proteins are exosite inhibitors, binding adjacent to the enzyme active site and inhibiting colicin activity indirectly. Unusually, their binding sites comprise a near contiguous sequence that lies N-terminal to active site sequences, raising the possibility that immunity proteins bind colicins co-translationally. Exosite binding accounts for the extensive sequence diversity seen at the interfaces of colicin-immunity protein complexes, which is not only a selective advantage to colicin-producing bacteria, but also represents a powerful model system for studying specificity in protein-protein recognition.},

Because P2X receptors are not related to other ion channel proteins of known structure, there is at present no molecular foundation for mechanisms of ligand-gating, allosteric modulation and ion permeation. Here we present crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X(4) receptor in its closed, resting state. The chalice-shaped, trimeric receptor is knit together by subunit-subunit contacts implicated in ion channel gating and receptor assembly. Extracellular domains, rich in beta-strands, have large acidic patches that may attract cations, through fenestrations, to vestibules near the ion channel. In the transmembrane pore, the 'gate' is defined by an approximately 8 A slab of protein. We define the location of three non-canonical, intersubunit ATP-binding sites, and suggest that ATP binding promotes subunit rearrangement and ion channel opening.},

Whether kinesin moves by a "hand-over-hand" or an "inchworm" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

abstract = {The structure determination of the ammonium transport protein AmtB from Escherichia coli strongly indicates that the members of the ubiquitous ammonium transporter/methylamine permease/Rhesus (Amt/MEP/Rh) protein family are ammonia-conducting channels rather than ammonium ion transporters. The most conserved part of these proteins, apart from the common overall structure with 11 transmembrane helices, is the pore lined by hydrophobic side chains except for two highly conserved histidine residues. A high-affinity ion-binding site specific for ammonium is present at the extracellular pore entry of the Amt/MEP proteins. It is proposed to play an important role in enhancing net transport at very low external ammonium concentrations and to provide discrimination against water. The site is not conserved in the animal Rhesus proteins which are implicated in ammonium homeostasis and saturate at millimolar ammonium concentrations. Many aspects of the biological function of these ammonia channels are still poorly understood and further studies in cellular systems are needed. Likewise, studies with purified, reconstituted Amt/MEP/Rh proteins will be needed to resolve open mechanistic questions and gain a more quantitative understanding of the conduction mechanism in general and for different subfamily representatives.},

abstract = {A common assumption in comparative genomics is that orthologous genes share greater functional similarity than do paralogous genes (the "ortholog conjecture"). Many methods used to computationally predict protein function are based on this assumption, even though it is largely untested. Here we present the first large-scale test of the ortholog conjecture using comparative functional genomic data from human and mouse. We use the experimentally derived functions of more than 8,900 genes, as well as an independent microarray dataset, to directly assess our ability to predict function using both orthologs and paralogs. Both datasets show that paralogs are often a much better predictor of function than are orthologs, even at lower sequence identities. Among paralogs, those found within the same species are consistently more functionally similar than those found in a different species. We also find that paralogous pairs residing on the same chromosome are more functionally similar than those on different chromosomes, perhaps due to higher levels of interlocus gene conversion between these pairs. In addition to offering implications for the computational prediction of protein function, our results shed light on the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence. We conclude that the most important factor in the evolution of function is not amino acid sequence, but rather the cellular context in which proteins act. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nehrt et al.},

We subjected F0 mice to odor fear conditioning before conception and found that subsequently conceived F1 and F2 generations had an increased behavioral sensitivity to the F0-conditioned odor, but not to other odors. When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm DNA from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed CpG hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes. Our findings provide a framework for addressing how environmental information may be inherited transgenerationally at behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic levels.},

For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here. Results: We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3 = 79{\%} ± 1, Q8 = 68{\%} ± 1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC = 0.59 ± 0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2vec-like approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10 = 68{\%} ± 1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2 = 87{\%} ± 1). Although SeqVec embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: Where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created embeddings on average in 0.03 s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases, SeqVec provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis. Conclusion: Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.},

abstract = {Genetic interactions provide a powerful perspective into gene function, but our knowledge of the specific mechanisms that give rise to these interactions is still relatively limited. The availability of a global genetic interaction map in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, covering similar to 30{\%} of all possible double mutant combinations, provides an unprecedented opportunity for an unbiased assessment of the native structure within genetic interaction networks and how it relates to gene function and modular organization. Toward this end, we developed a data mining approach to exhaustively discover all block structures within this network, which allowed for its complete modular decomposition. The resulting modular structures revealed the importance of the context of individual genetic interactions in their interpretation and revealed distinct trends among genetic interaction hubs as well as insights into the evolution of duplicate genes. Block membership also revealed a surprising degree of multifunctionality across the yeast genome and enabled a novel association of VIP1 and IPK1 with DNA replication and repair, which is supported by experimental evidence. Our modular decomposition also provided a basis for testing the between-pathway model of negative genetic interactions and within-pathway model of positive genetic interactions. While we find that most modular structures involving negative genetic interactions fit the between-pathway model, we found that current models for positive genetic interactions fail to explain 80{\%} of the modular structures detected. We also find differences between the modular structures of essential and nonessential genes.},

After induction with low concentrations of mitomycin C, these organisms differed with regards to cell growth, cell viability, and kinetics of colicin A biosynthesis. Despite these differences, immunoferritin labelling on ultra-thin sections of induced frozen cells demonstrated that colicin A was located exclusively within the cell cytoplasm in both types of bacteria. By using protein markers, it was shown that at no time after induction was colicin A accumulated in the periplasmic space or in inner or outer membranes. These results were confirmed by a biochemical approach. For at least 3 h after induction, colicin A remained associated with producing cells and no colicin A activity was found in the periplasmic space. These results are discussed with reference to the synthesis and export of other bacteriocins.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract = {In addition to protein-coding genes, mammalian pol II (RNA polymerase II) transcribes independent genes for some non-coding RNAs, including the spliceosomal U1 and U2 snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs). snRNA genes differ from protein-coding genes in several key respects and some of the mechanisms involved in expression are gene-type-specific. For example, snRNA gene promoters contain an essential PSE (proximal sequence element) unique to these genes, the RNA-encoding regions contain no introns, elongation of transcription is P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b)-independent and RNA 3'-end formation is directed by a 3'-box rather than a cleavage and polyadenylation signal. However, the CTD (C-terminal domain) of pol II closely couples transcription with RNA 5' and 3' processing in expression of both gene types. Recently, it was shown that snRNA promoter-specific recognition of the 3'-box RNA processing signal requires a novel phosphorylation mark on the pol II CTD. This new mark plays a critical role in the recruitment of the snRNA gene-specific RNA-processing complex, Integrator. These new findings provide the first example of a phosphorylation mark on the CTD heptapeptide that can be read in a gene-type-specific manner, reinforcing the notion of a CTD code. Here, we review the control of expression of snRNA genes from initiation to termination of transcription.},

We have determined a crystal structure of the full-length channel at a resolution of 3.2 A, and of the isolated voltage-sensor domain at 1.9 A, both in complex with monoclonal Fab fragments. The channel contains a central ion-conduction pore surrounded by voltage sensors, which form what we call 'voltage-sensor paddles'-hydrophobic, cationic, helix-turn-helix structures on the channel's outer perimeter. Flexible hinges suggest that the voltage-sensor paddles move in response to membrane voltage changes, carrying their positive charge across the membrane.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) mediate rapid excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems. They transduce binding of nerve-released ACh into opening of an intrinsic channel, yet the structural basis underlying transduction is not fully understood. Previous studies revealed a principal transduction pathway in which alphaArg 209 of the pre-M1 domain and alphaGlu 45 of the beta1-beta2 loop functionally link the two regions, positioning alphaVal 46 of the beta1-beta2 loop in a cavity formed by alphaPro 272 through alphaSer 269 of the M2-M3 loop. Here we investigate contributions of residues within and proximal to this pathway using single-channel kinetic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis. We find that in contributing to channel gating, alphaVal 46 and alphaVal 132 of the signature Cys loop couple energetically to alphaPro 272. Furthermore, these residues are optimized in both their size and hydrophobicity to mediate rapid and efficient channel gating, suggesting naturally occurring substitutions at these positions enable a diverse range of gating rate constants among the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. The overall results indicate that alphaPro 272 functionally couples to flanking Val residues extending from the beta1-beta2 and Cys loops within the ACh binding to channel opening transduction pathway.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, the most widely used system for generating spatially restricted transgene expression is based on the yeast GAL4 protein and its target upstream activating sequence (UAS). To permit temporal as well as spatial control over UAS-transgene expression, we have explored the use of a conditional RU486-dependent GAL4 protein (GeneSwitch) in Drosophila. By using cloned promoter fragments of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision gene or the myosin heavy chain gene, we have expressed GeneSwitch specifically in neurons or muscles and show that its transcriptional activity within the target tissues depends on the presence of the activator RU486 (mifepristone). We used available UAS-reporter lines to demonstrate RU486-dependent tissue-specific transgene expression in larvae. Reporter protein expression could be detected 5 h after systemic application of RU486 by either feeding or "larval bathing." Transgene expression levels were dose-dependent on RU486 concentration in larval food, with low background expression in the absence of RU486. By using genetically altered ion channels as reporters, we were able to change the physiological properties of larval bodywall muscles in an RU486-dependent fashion. We demonstrate here the applicability of GeneSwitch for conditional tissue-specific expression in Drosophila, and we provide tools to control pre- and postsynaptic expression of transgenes at the larval neuromuscular junction during postembryonic life.},

abstract = {Protein-lipid interactions regulate many membrane protein functions. Using a multiscale approach that combines coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have predicted the binding site for the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) on the Kir2.2 inwardly rectifying (Kir) potassium channel. Comparison of the predicted binding site to that observed in the recent PIP(2)-bound crystal structure of Kir2.2 reveals good agreement between simulation and experiment. In addition to providing insight into the mechanism by which PIP(2) binds to Kir2.2, these results help to establish the validity of this multiscale simulation approach and its future application in the examination of novel membrane protein-lipid interactions in the increasing number of high-resolution membrane protein structures that are now available.},

At neutral pH, however, {\textgreater}99{\%} of DTT thiol groups are protonated and thus unreactive. Herein, we report on (2S)-2-amino-1,4-dimercaptobutane (dithiobutylamine or DTBA), a dithiol that can be synthesized from l-aspartic acid in a few high-yielding steps that are amenable to a large-scale process. DTBA has thiol pK(a) values that are {\~{}}1 unit lower than those of DTT and forms a disulfide with a similar E°' value. DTBA reduces disulfide bonds in both small molecules and proteins faster than does DTT. The amino group of DTBA enables its isolation by cation-exchange and facilitates its conjugation.

Each subunit of TatA consists of a transmembrane segment, an amphiphilic helix (APH), and a C-terminal densely charged region (DCR). The sequence of charges in the DCR is complementary to the charge pattern on the APH, suggesting that the protein can be "zipped up" by a ladder of seven salt bridges. The length of the resulting hairpin matches the lipid bilayer thickness, hence a transmembrane pore could self-assemble via intra- and intermolecular salt bridges. The steric feasibility was rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental evidence was obtained by monitoring the monomer-oligomer equilibrium of specific charge mutants. Similar "charge zippers" are proposed for other membrane-associated proteins, e.g.; the biofilm-inducing peptide TisB, the human antimicrobial peptide dermcidin, and the pestiviral ERNS protein. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281{\%} increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200{\%}. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature.

@article{Pierri2010,
abstract = {The functional characterization of proteins represents a daily challenge for biochemical, medical and computational sciences. Although finally proved on the bench, the function of a protein can be successfully predicted by computational approaches that drive the further experimental assays. Current methods for comparative modeling allow the construction of accurate 3D models for proteins of unknown structure, provided that a crystal structure of a homologous protein is available. Binding regions can be proposed by using binding site predictors, data inferred from homologous crystal structures, and data provided from a careful interpretation of the multiple sequence alignment of the investigated protein and its homologs. Once the location of a binding site has been proposed, chemical ligands that have a high likelihood of binding can be identified by using ligand docking and structure-based virtual screening of chemical libraries. Most docking algorithms allow building a list sorted by energy of the lowest energy docking configuration for each ligand of the library. In this review the state-of-the-art of computational approaches in 3D protein comparative modeling and in the study of protein-ligand interactions is provided. Furthermore a possible combined/concerted multistep strategy for protein function prediction, based on multiple sequence alignment, comparative modeling, binding region prediction, and structure-based virtual screening of chemical libraries, is described by using suitable examples. As practical examples, Abl-kinase molecular modeling studies, HPV-E6 protein multiple sequence alignment analysis, and some other model docking-based characterization reports are briefly described to highlight the importance of computational approaches in protein function prediction.},

abstract = {Diffusion of two Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins-the cobalamin (vitamin B12) receptor (BtuB) and the OmpF porin, which are implicated in the cellular import pathways of colicins and phages-was measured in vivo. The lateral mobility of these proteins is relevant to the mechanism of formation of the translocon for cellular import of colicins such as the rRNase colicin E3. The diffusion coefficient (D) of BtuB, the primary colicin receptor, complexed to fluorescent antibody or colicin, is 0.05±0.01 $\mu$m2/s and 0.10±0.02 $\mu$m2/s, respectively, over a timescale of 25-150 ms. Mutagenesis of the BtuB TonB box, which eliminates or significantly weakens the interaction between BtuB and the TonB energy-transducing protein that is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane, resulted in a fivefold larger value of D, 0.27±0.06 $\mu$m2/s for antibody-labeled BtuB, indicating a cytoskeletal-like interaction of TonB with BtuB. OmpF has a diffusion coefficient of 0.006±0.002 $\mu$m2/s, ∼10-fold smaller than that of BtuB, and is restricted within a domain of diameter 100 nm, showing it to be relatively immobile compared to BtuB. Thus, formation of the outer membrane translocon for cellular import of the nuclease colicins is a demonstrably dynamic process, because it depends on lateral diffusion of BtuB and collisional interaction with relatively immobile OmpF.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, there is evidence for functional coupling between transcription and processing of pre-mRNAs. To better understand this coupling, we performed a high-resolution kinetic analysis of transcription and splicing in budding yeast. This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, RNA polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced mRNA and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint associated with cotranscriptional splicing.},

Using real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (EM), and atomic structure fitting, we have mapped the structure and assembly pathways of a bacterial CDC in unprecedented detail and accuracy, focussing on suilysin from Streptococcus suis. We show that suilysin assembly is a noncooperative process that is terminated before the protein inserts into the membrane. The resulting ring-shaped pores and kinetically trapped arc-shaped assemblies are all seen to perforate the membrane, as also visible by the ejection of its lipids. Membrane insertion requires a concerted conformational change of the monomeric subunits, with a marked expansion in pore diameter due to large changes in subunit structure and packing.},

Here we investigate the requirements for genes that execute and regulate programmed cell death (PCD) in necrotic-like neuronal death caused by a toxic MEC-4 channel. Neither the kinetics of necrosis onset nor the total number of necrotic corpses generated is altered by any C. elegans mutation known to block PCD, which provides genetic evidence that the activating mechanisms for NCD and apoptotic cell death are distinct. In contrast, all previously reported ced genes required for phagocytotic removal of apoptotic corpses, as well as ced-12, a new engulfment gene we have identified, are required for efficient elimination of corpses generated by distinct necrosis-inducing stimuli. Our results show that a common set of genes acts to eliminate cell corpses irrespective of the mode of cell death, and provide the first identification of the C. elegans genes that are required for orderly removal of necrotic cells. As phagocytotic mechanisms seem to be conserved from nematodes to humans, our findings indicate that injured necrotic cells in higher organisms might also be eliminated before lysis through a controlled process of corpse removal, a hypothesis that has significant therapeutic implications.},

abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81-99{\%} of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are membrane-spanning neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that are responsible for fast excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the peripheral and central nervous systems. The best studied members of the Cys-loop family are nACh, 5-HT3, GABAA and glycine receptors. All these receptors share a common structure of five subunits, pseudo-symmetrically arranged to form a rosette with a central ion-conducting pore. Some are cation selective (e.g. nACh and 5-HT3) and some are anion selective (e.g. GABAA and glycine). Each receptor has an extracellular domain (ECD) that contains the ligand-binding sites, a transmembrane domain (TMD) that allows ions to pass across the membrane, and an intracellular domain (ICD) that plays a role in channel conductance and receptor modulation. Cys-loop receptors are the targets for many currently used clinically relevant drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines and anaesthetics). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these receptors could therefore provide the catalyst for further development in this field, as well as promoting the development of experimental techniques for other areas of neuroscience.In this review, we present our current understanding of Cys-loop receptor structure and function. The ECD has been extensively studied. Research in this area has been stimulated in recent years by the publication of high-resolution structures of nACh receptors and related proteins, which have permitted the creation of many Cys loop receptor homology models of this region. Here, using the 5-HT3 receptor as a typical member of the family, we describe how homology modelling and ligand docking can provide useful but not definitive information about ligand interactions. We briefly consider some of the many Cys-loop receptors modulators. We discuss the current understanding of the structure of the TMD, and how this links to the ECD to allow channel gating, and consider the roles of the ICD, whose structure is poorly understood. We also describe some of the current methods that are beginning to reveal the differences between different receptor states, and may ultimately show structural details of transitions between them.},

It illustrates different ways of overcoming the various difficulties encountered and discusses the method, sequential structure alignment program (SSAP) and the various modifications that are required to handle complex similarities. The need to identify similar motifs among proteins and the development of a multiple comparison method that can identify the consensus structure for a family of related proteins are discussed. Analysis of protein structural families and identification of consensus structural templates will improve both template- and threading-based prediction algorithms for identifying the fold of a protein, particularly for the superfolds. For more complex and less frequently observed folds, characterization of common structural motifs and any associated sequence patterns would be expected to improve prediction.},

Here we report the crystal structure of an open-channel conformation of NavMs, the bacterial channel pore from the marine bacterium Magnetococcus sp. (strain MC-1). It differs from the recently published crystal structure of a closed form of a related bacterial sodium channel (NavAb) by having its internal cavity accessible to the cytoplasmic surface as a result of a bend/rotation about a central residue in the carboxy-terminal transmembrane segment. This produces an open activation gate of sufficient diameter to allow hydrated sodium ions to pass through. Comparison of the open and closed structures provides new insight into the features of the functional states present in the activation cycles of sodium channels and the mechanism of channel opening and closing.},

Its unique challenges come from the existence of multiple types of nodes and links, which limit the feasibility of the conventional network embedding techniques. We develop two scalable representation learning models, namely metapath2vec and metapath2vec++. The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path-based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease with a fatal outcome. Although the disease-causing gene (huntingtin) has been known for over 20 years, the exact mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death are still controversial. One potential mechanism contributing to the massive loss of neurons observed in the brain of HD patients could be the unfolded protein response (UPR) activated by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As an adaptive response to counter-balance accumulation of un- or misfolded proteins, the UPR upregulates transcription of chaperones, temporarily attenuates new translation, and activates protein degradation via the proteasome. However, persistent ER stress and an activated UPR can also cause apoptotic cell death. Although different studies have indicated a role for the UPR in HD, the evidence remains inconclusive. Here, we present extensive bioinformatic analyses that revealed UPR activation in different experimental HD models based on transcriptomic data. Accordingly, we have identified 58 genes, including RAB5A, HMGB1, CTNNB1, DNM1, TUBB, TSG101, EEF2, DYNC1H1 and SLC12A5that provide a potential link between UPR and HD. To further elucidate the potential role of UPR as a disease-relevant process, we examined its connection to apoptosis based on molecular interaction data, and identified a set of 40 genes including ADD1, HSP90B1, IKBKB, IKBKG, RPS3A and LMNB1, which seem to be at the crossroads between these two important cellular processes.},

abstract = {The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) machinery transports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. It has been inferred that the Tat translocation site is assembled on demand by substrate-induced association of the protein TatA. We tested this model by imaging YFP-tagged TatA expressed at native levels in living Escherichia coli cells in the presence of low levels of the TatA paralogue TatE. Under these conditions the TatA-YFP fusion supports full physiological Tat transport activity. In agreement with the TatA association model, raising the number of transport-competent substrate proteins within the cell leads to an increase in the number of large TatA complexes present. Formation of these complexes requires both a functional TatBC substrate receptor and the transmembrane proton motive force (PMF). Removing the PMF causes TatA complexes to dissociate, except in strains with impaired Tat transport activity. Based on these observations we propose that TatA assembly reaches a critical point at which oligomerization can be reversed only by substrate transport. In contrast to TatA-YFP, the oligomeric states of TatB-YFP and TatC-YFP fusions are not affected by substrate or the PMF, although TatB-YFP oligomerization does require TatC.},

Two base pair transversions (G to T, A to C) from the normal sequence predict Lys to Asn and Met to Leu amino acid substitutions at codons 670 and 671 of the APP transcript. This mutation occurs at the amino terminal of $\beta$–amyloid and may be pathogenic because it occurs at or close to the endosomal/lysosomal cleavage site of the molecule. Thus, pathogenic mutations in APP frame the $\beta$–amyloid sequence. {\textcopyright} 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

The effectiveness of Trastuzumab has been well validated in research as well as in clinical practice. The addition of Trastuzumab to standard of care chemotherapy in clinical trials has been shown to improve outcomes for early stage as well as metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. The most clinically significant side effect of Trastuzumab is the risk of cardiac myocyte injury, leading to the development of congestive heart failure.

abstract = {All cells count on precise mechanisms that regulate protein homeostasis to maintain a stable and functional proteome. A progressive deterioration in the ability of cells to preserve the stability of their proteome occurs with age and contributes to the functional loss characteristic of old organisms. Molecular chaperones and the proteolytic systems are responsible for this cellular quality control by assuring continuous renewal of intracellular proteins. When protein damage occurs, such as during cellular stress, the coordinated action of these cellular surveillance systems allows detection and repair of the damaged structures or, in many instances, leads to the complete elimination of the altered proteins from inside cells. Dysfunction of the quality control mechanisms and intracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins in the form of protein inclusions and aggregates occur in almost all tissues of an aged organism. Preservation or enhancement of the activity of these surveillance systems until late in life improves their resistance to stress and is sufficient to slow down aging. In this work, we review recent advances on our understanding of the contribution of chaperones and proteolytic systems to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, the cellular response to stress and ultimately to longevity.},

The polypeptide chain of 204 amino acid residues consists of ten alpha-helices organized in a three-layer structure. The helices range in length from 9 to 23 residues with an average length of 125 residues. The packing arrangement of the helices has been analysed; the packing is different from that observed in four-helix bundle proteins. The sites of 83 water molecules have been located and refined. Analysis of the structure provides insights into the mechanism of formation of a voltage-gated channel by the protein. Although it is proposed that substantial tertiary structural changes occur during membrane insertion, the secondary structural elements remain conserved. This idea has been proposed recently for a number of other protein-membrane events and thus may have more general applicability.},

abstract = {Peptides extracted from HLA-A2.1 class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the antigen processing mutant CEMx721.174.T2 were characterized by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Only seven dominant peptides were found, in contrast to over 200 associated with HLA-A2.1 on normal cells. These peptides were derived from the signal peptide domains of normal cellular proteins, were usually larger than nine residues, and were also associated with HLA-A2.1 in normal cells. These results suggest that proteolysis of signal peptide domains in the endoplasmic reticulum is a second mechanism for processing and presentation of peptides for association with class I molecules.},

abstract = {Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) longer than a few hundred nucleotides do not have a unique structure in solution. Their equilibrium properties therefore reflect the average of an ensemble of structures. We use cryo-electron microscopy to image projections of individual long ssRNA molecules and characterize the anisotropy of their ensembles in solution. A flattened prolate volume is found to best represent the shapes of these ensembles. The measured sizes and anisotropies are in good agreement with complementary determinations using small-angle X-ray scattering and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. A long viral ssRNA is compared with shorter noncoding transcripts to demonstrate that prolate geometry and flatness are generic properties independent of sequence length and origin. The anisotropy persists under physiological as well as low-ionic-strength conditions, revealing a direct correlation between secondary structure asymmetry and 3D shape and size. We discuss the physical origin of the generic anisotropy and its biological implications.},

Here, we discuss the sampling properties of a network's degree distribution under the most parsimonious sampling scheme. Only if the degree distributions of the network and randomly sampled subnets belong to the same family of probability distributions is it possible to extrapolate from subnet data to properties of the global network. We show that this condition is indeed satisfied for some important classes of networks, notably classical random graphs and exponential random graphs. For scale-free degree distributions, however, this is not the case. Thus, inferences about the scale-free nature of a network may have to be treated with some caution. The work presented here has important implications for the analysis of molecular networks as well as for graph theory and the theory of networks in general.},

abstract = {The mammalian gut harbors a dense microbial community interacting in multiple ways, including horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Pangenome analyses established particularly high levels of genetic flux between Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. However, the mechanisms fostering intraenterobacterial HGT are incompletely understood. Using a mouse colitis model, we found that Salmonella-inflicted enteropathy elicits parallel blooms of the pathogen and of resident commensal Escherichia coli. These blooms boosted conjugative HGT of the colicin-plasmid p2 from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to E. coli. Transconjugation efficiencies of {\~{}}100{\%} in vivo were attributable to high intrinsic p2-transfer rates. Plasmid-encoded fitness benefits contributed little. Under normal conditions, HGT was blocked by the commensal microbiota inhibiting contact-dependent conjugation between Enterobacteriaceae. Our data show that pathogen-driven inflammatory responses in the gut can generate transient enterobacterial blooms in which conjugative transfer occurs at unprecedented rates. These blooms may favor reassortment of plasmid-encoded genes between pathogens and commensals fostering the spread of fitness-, virulence-, and antibiotic-resistance determinants.},

abstract = {The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are high-conductance intracellular Ca(2+) channels that play a pivotal role in the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal and cardiac muscles. RyRs are the largest known ion channels, with a homotetrameric organization and approximately 5,000 residues in each protomer. Here we report the structure of the rabbit RyR1 in complex with its modulator FKBP12 at an overall resolution of 3.8 {\AA}, determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. Three previously uncharacterized domains, named central, handle and helical domains, display the armadillo repeat fold. These domains, together with the amino-terminal domain, constitute a network of superhelical scaffold for binding and propagation of conformational changes. The channel domain exhibits the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily fold with distinct features. A negative-charge-enriched hairpin loop connecting S5 and the pore helix is positioned above the entrance to the selectivity-filter vestibule. The four elongated S6 segments form a right-handed helical bundle that closes the pore at the cytoplasmic border of the membrane. Allosteric regulation of the pore by the cytoplasmic domains is mediated through extensive interactions between the central domains and the channel domain. These structural features explain high ion conductance by RyRs and the long-range allosteric regulation of channel activities.},

There is now information on the enzyme structure at all levels from primary (amino acid sequence) to quaternary (dimerization, association with other proteins) structure. The crystal structures of the oxygenase domains of inducible NOS (iNOS) and vascular endothelial NOS (eNOS) allow us to interpret other information in the context of this important part of the enzyme, with its binding sites for iron protoporphyrin IX (haem), biopterin, L-arginine, and the many inhibitors which interact with them. The exact nature of the NOS reaction, its mechanism and its products continue to be sources of controversy. The role of the biopterin cofactor is now becoming clearer, with emerging data implicating one-electron redox cycling as well as the multiple allosteric effects on enzyme activity. Regulation of the NOSs has been described at all levels from gene transcription to covalent modification and allosteric regulation of the enzyme itself. A wide range of NOS inhibitors have been discussed, interacting with the enzyme in diverse ways in terms of site and mechanism of inhibition, time-dependence and selectivity for individual isoforms, although there are many pitfalls and misunderstandings of these aspects. Highly selective inhibitors of iNOS versus eNOS and neuronal NOS have been identified and some of these have potential in the treatment of a range of inflammatory and other conditions in which iNOS has been implicated.},

abstract = {When humans are exposed to hypoxia, systemic and intracellular changes operate together to minimise hypoxic injury and restore adequate oxygenation. Emerging evidence indicates that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors plays a central regulatory role in these homeostatic changes at both the systemic and cellular levels. HIF was discovered through its action as the transcriptional activator of erythropoietin, and has subsequently been found to control intracellular hypoxic responses throughout the body. HIF is primarily regulated by specific prolyl hydroxylase-domain enzymes (PHDs) that initiate its degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL). The oxygen and iron dependency of PHD activity accounts for regulation of the pathway by both cellular oxygen and iron status. Recent studies conducted in patients with rare genetic diseases have begun to uncover the wider importance of the PHD-VHL-HIF axis in systems-level human biology. These studies indicate that, in addition to regulating erythropoiesis, the system plays an important role in cardiopulmonary regulation. This article reviews our current understanding of the importance of HIF in human systems-level physiology, and is modelled around the classic physiological response to high-altitude hypoxia.},

PARPs act in a complex response network that is driven by the cellular, molecular and chemical biology of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR).

Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is providing key information regarding the evolutionary and functional diversity of microbial life, it has become impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination. Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and generally make use of a limited number of "marker" genes conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the position of a genome within a reference genome tree and information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes. CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome completeness and contamination and to outperform existing approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes suitable for specific gene- and genome-centric analyses of microbial communities.},

We prove that statement for a particular personalization vector in the definition of the PageRank, and we also show that in general, the PageRank of an undirected graph is not exactly proportional to the degree distribution of the graph: our main theorem gives an upper and a lower bound to the L1 norm of the difference of the PageRank and the degree distribution vectors. A necessary and sufficient condition is also given for the PageRank for being proportional to the degree.},

Moreover, it allows for the extraction of the essential degrees of freedom, which, in general, are the biologically relevant ones. The method rests on a reliable estimate of the stability of interactions observed in a starting structure, in particular those interactions that change during a conformational transition.

This was particularly thought to be the case for symmetrically dividing species, as such species lack a clear distinction between the soma and the germline. Despite this, studies of the symmetrically dividing model species Escherichia coli and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have recently started to challenge this notion. They indicate that E. coli and S. pombe do age, but only when subjected to environmental stress. If true, this suggests that aging may be widespread among unicellular species in general, and that studying aging in microbes may inform other long-standing questions in the field of aging. This review examines the recent evidence for and against replicative aging in symmetrically dividing unicellular organisms, the mechanisms that underlie aging, why aging evolved in these species, and how microbial aging fits into the context of other questions in aging.},

In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

Nevertheless, PARP1-/- mice are viable, fertile and do not develop early onset tumours. Here, we show that PARP inhibitors trigger gamma-H2AX and RAD51 foci formation. We propose that, in the absence of PARP1, spontaneous single-strand breaks collapse replication forks and trigger homologous recombination for repair. Furthermore, we show that BRCA2-deficient cells, as a result of their deficiency in homologous recombination, are acutely sensitive to PARP inhibitors, presumably because resultant collapsed replication forks are no longer repaired. Thus, PARP1 activity is essential in homologous recombination-deficient BRCA2 mutant cells. We exploit this requirement in order to kill BRCA2-deficient tumours by PARP inhibition alone. Treatment with PARP inhibitors is likely to be highly tumour specific, because only the tumours (which are BRCA2-/-) in BRCA2+/- patients are defective in homologous recombination. The use of an inhibitor of a DNA repair enzyme alone to selectively kill a tumour, in the absence of an exogenous DNA-damaging agent, represents a new concept in cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Objectives (S)-Leucoxine, isolated from the Colombian Lauraceae tree Rhodostemonodaphne crenaticupula Madri{\~{n}}an, was found to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. A biomimetic approach for the chemical synthesis of a wide array of 1-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines was undertaken with the aim of elucidating a common pharmacophore for these compounds with novel mode(s) of anti-TB action. Methods Biomimetic Pictet–Spengler or Bischler–Napieralski synthetic routes were employed followed by an evaluation of the biological activity of the synthesized compounds. Results In this work, the synthesized tetrahydroisoquinolines were found to inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and affect its whole-cell phenotype as well as the activity of the ATP-dependent MurE ligase, a key enzyme involved in the early stage of cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Conclusions As the correlation between the MIC and the half-inhibitory enzymatic concentration was not particularly strong, there is a credible possibility that these compounds have pleiotropic mechanism(s) of action in M. tuberculosis.},

Here we report recent developments with DisProt (version 8), including the doubling of protein entries, a new disorder ontology, improvements of the annotation format and a completely new website. The website includes a redesigned graphical interface, a better search engine, a clearer API for programmatic access and a new annotation interface that integrates text mining technologies. The new entry format provides a greater flexibility, simplifies maintenance and allows the capture of more information from the literature. The new disorder ontology has been formalized and made interoperable by adopting the OWL format, as well as its structure and term definitions have been improved. The new annotation interface has made the curation process faster and more effective. We recently showed that new DisProt annotations can be effectively used to train and validate disorder predictors. We believe the growth of DisProt will accelerate, contributing to the improvement of function and disorder predictors and therefore to illuminate the 'dark' proteome.},

abstract = {The mechanisms permitting nonpolymorphic CD1 molecules to present lipid antigens that differ considerably in polar head and aliphatic tails remain elusive. It is also unclear why hydrophobic motifs in the aliphatic tails of some antigens, which presumably embed inside CD1 pockets, contribute to determinants for T-cell recognition. The 1.9-{\AA} crystal structure of an active complex of CD1b and a mycobacterial diacylsulfoglycolipid presented here provides some clues. Upon antigen binding, endogenous spacers of CD1b, which consist of a mixture of diradylglycerols, moved considerably within the lipid-binding groove. Spacer displacement was accompanied by F' pocket closure and an extensive rearrangement of residues exposed to T-cell receptors. Such structural reorganization resulted in reduction of the A' pocket capacity and led to incomplete embedding of the methyl-ramified portion of the phthioceranoyl chain of the antigen, explaining why such hydrophobic motifs are critical for T-cell receptor recognition. Mutagenesis experiments supported the functional importance of the observed structural alterations for T-cell stimulation. Overall, our data delineate a complex molecular mechanism combining spacer repositioning and ligand-induced conformational changes that, together with pocket intricacy, endows CD1b with the required molecular plasticity to present a broad range of structurally diverse antigens.},

abstract = {Despite the absence of phenotypic manifestations in alternating generations characteristic of X-linked disorders, a thesis is presented that a major type of Kinsey grades 5 and 6 male homosexuality is determined by a gene in the Xq28 region. A total of 133 families in 78 kinshps of male and female homosexual probands, in addition to 116 families (including those of 40 famous homosexuals) from the literature, revealed an unbalanced secondary sex ratio in the maternal generation of male, but not of female, homosexuals. On the maternal side, in this study, the ratio of all uncles to all aunts of 90 males homosexuals was 132/209, chi 2 = 8.52, p = 0.004. On the maternal side for the total of all sources, the ratio of uncles to aunts of male homosexuals was 241/367, chi 2 = 13.20; p {\textless} 0.0001. The male/female ratio of the total number of maternal sibships bearing homosexuals (310/628: 0.491) was a measure of fetal wastage of the mothers' male sibs; 49{\%}. This ratio was very close to that of the total number of children born to fathers affected with any one of nine Xq28-linked male semilethal conditions (255/508: ratio 0.556); for the difference between the two populations chi 2 = 0.859, p = 0.354. The male/female ratio of the total number of children born to female carriers of any one of these same conditions (1,232/1,062: ratio 1.16), chi 2 = 13.8 p {\textless} or = 0.0001, is close to that of the total number of children in homosexual sibships: 511/413, chi 2 = 10.4, p = 0.005. Between the number of children born to Xq28 mothers and to those born of mothers of homosexuals chi 2 = 0.581, p = 0.446. One may readily surmise that the maternal influence so often related to homosexuality may lie in the mother being a genetic carrier, with traits thereto associated. In this study, 65{\%} of the mothers of homosexuals had no or only one live-born brother. Additional support for a genetic hypothesis is found in the occurrence of multiple instances--almost exclusively among maternal relatives--of infertility, spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, stillbirths, remaining single past age 30, and suicide. Of 109 male and 43 female homosexual index cases in the present series there were 6 instances of brother/sister homosexual sibships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Between the 1930s and 1950s, scientists developed key principles of population genetics to try and explain the aging process. Almost a century later, these aging theories, including antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation, have been experimentally validated in animals. Although the theories have been much harder to test in humans despite research dating back to the 1970s, recent research is closing this evidence gap. Here we examine the strength of evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy in humans, one of the leading evolutionary explanations for the retention of genetic risk variation for non-communicable diseases. We discuss the analytical tools and types of data that are used to test for patterns of antagonistic pleiotropy and provide a primer of evolutionary theory on types of selection as a guide for understanding this mechanism and how it may manifest in other diseases. We find an abundance of non-experimental evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy in many diseases. In some cases, several studies have independently found corroborating evidence for this mechanism in the same or related sets of diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies also suggest antagonistic pleiotropy may be involved in cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There are also compelling examples of disease risk variants that confer fitness benefits ranging from resistance to other diseases or survival in extreme environments. This provides increasingly strong support for the theory that antagonistic pleiotropic variants have enabled improved fitness but have been traded for higher burden of disease later in life. Future research in this field is required to better understand how this mechanism influences contemporary disease and possible consequences for their treatment.},

abstract = {Hundreds of genes are proposed to contribute to nociception and pain perception. Historically, most studies of pain-related genes have examined them in isolation or alongside a handful of other genes. More recently the use of systems biology techniques has enabled us to study genes in the context of the biological pathways and networks in which they operate. Here we describe a Web-based resource, available at http://www.PainNetworks.org. It integrates interaction data from various public databases with information on known pain genes taken from several sources (eg, The Pain Genes Database) and allows the user to examine a gene (or set of genes) of interest alongside known interaction partners. This information is displayed by the resource in the form of a network. The user can enrich these networks by using data from pain-focused gene expression studies to highlight genes that change expression in a given experiment or pairs of genes showing correlated expression patterns across different experiments. Genes in the networks are annotated in several ways including biological function and drug binding. The Web site can be used to find out more about a gene of interest by looking at the function of its interaction partners. It can also be used to interpret the results of a functional genomics experiment by revealing putative novel pain-related genes that have similar expression patterns to known pain-related genes and by ranking genes according to their network connections with known pain genes. We expect this resource to grow over time and become a valuable asset to the pain community. ?? 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In addition to chemical controls, traditional microbiological water tests focus on the detection of specific bacterial pathogens. The direct tracing of all aquatic DNA poses a more profound alternative. Yet, this has hitherto been underused due to challenges in cost and logistics. Here we present a simple, fast, inexpensive and comprehensive freshwater diagnostics workflow centred around portable nanopore DNA sequencing. Using defined bacterial compositions and spatiotemporal microbiota from surface water of an example river in Cambridge (UK), our study shows how nanopore sequencing can be readily integrated for the assessment of aquatic bacterial diversity and pollution. We provide a computational benchmark that features more than ten taxonomic classification tools to derive guidelines for bacterial DNA analyses with nanopore data. Through complementary physicochemical measurements, we find that nanopore metagenomics can depict fine temporal gradients along the main hydrological axis of an urban-rural interface and yield high-resolution pathogen maps that address concerns of public health.},

abstract = {Calorie restriction (CR) and rapamycin (RP) extend lifespan and improve health across model organisms. Both treatments inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, a conserved longevity pathway and a key regulator of protein homeostasis, yet their effects on proteome homeostasis are relatively unknown. To comprehensively study the effects of aging, CR, and RP on protein homeostasis, we performed the first simultaneous measurement of mRNA translation, protein turnover, and abundance in livers of young (3 month) and old (25 month) mice subjected to 10-week RP or 40{\%} CR. Protein abundance and turnover were measured in vivo using (2) H3 -leucine heavy isotope labeling followed by LC-MS/MS, and translation was assessed by polysome profiling. We observed 35-60{\%} increased protein half-lives after CR and 15{\%} increased half-lives after RP compared to age-matched controls. Surprisingly, the effects of RP and CR on protein turnover and abundance differed greatly between canonical pathways, with opposite effects in mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction and eIF2 signaling pathways. CR most closely recapitulated the young phenotype in the top pathways. Polysome profiles indicated that CR reduced polysome loading while RP increased polysome loading in young and old mice, suggesting distinct mechanisms of reduced protein synthesis. CR and RP both attenuated protein oxidative damage. Our findings collectively suggest that CR and RP extend lifespan in part through the reduction of protein synthetic burden and damage and a concomitant increase in protein quality. However, these results challenge the notion that RP is a faithful CR mimetic and highlight mechanistic differences between the two interventions.},

Colicin M is unique among these toxins in that it acts in the periplasm and specifically inhibits murein biosynthesis by hydrolyzing the pyrophosphate linkage between bactoprenol and the murein precursor. We crystallized colicin M and determined the structure at 1.7A resolution using x-ray crystallography. The protein has a novel structure composed of three domains with distinct functions. The N-domain is a short random coil and contains the exposed TonB box. The central domain includes a hydrophobic alpha-helix and binds presumably to the FhuA receptor. The C-domain is composed of a mixed alpha/beta-fold and forms the phosphatase. The architectures of the individual modules show no similarity to known structures. Amino acid replacements in previously isolated inactive colicin M mutants are located in the phosphatase domain, which contains a number of surface-exposed residues conserved in predicted bacteriocins of other bacteria. The novel phosphatase domain displays no sequence similarity to known phosphatases. The N-terminal and central domains are not conserved among bacteriocins, which likely reflect the distinct import proteins required for the uptake of the various bacteriocins. The homology pattern supports our previous proposal that colicins evolved by combination of distinct functional domains.},

@article{Bader2003,
abstract = {Background: Recent advances in proteomics technologies such as two-hybrid, phage display and mass spectrometry have enabled us to create a detailed map of biomolecular interaction networks. Initial mapping efforts have already produced a wealth of data. As the size of the interaction set increases, databases and computational methods will be required to store, visualize and analyze the information in order to effectively aid in knowledge discovery. Results: This paper describes a novel graph theoretic clustering algorithm, "Molecular Complex Detectio" (MCODE), that detects densely connected regions in large protein-protein interaction networks that may represent molecular complexes. The method is based on vertex weighting by local neighborhood density and outward traversal from a locally dense seed protein to isolate the dense regions according to given parameters. The algorithm has the advantage over other graph clustering methods of having a directed mode that allows fine-tuning of clusters of interest without considering the rest of the network and allows examination of cluster interconnectivity, which is relevant for protein networks. Protein interaction and complex information from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for evaluation. Conclusion: Dense regions of protein interaction networks can be found, based solely on connectivity data, many of which correspond to known protein complexes. The algorithm is not affected by a known high rate of false positives in data from high-throughput interaction techniques. {\textcopyright} 2003 Bader and Hogue; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

It is widely assumed that orthologs share similar functions, whereas paralogs are expected to diverge more from each other. But does this assumption hold up on further examination? We present evidence that orthologs and paralogs are not so different in either their evolutionary rates or their mechanisms of divergence. We emphasize the importance of appropriately designed studies to test models of gene evolution between orthologs and between paralogs. Thus, functional change between orthologs might be as common as between paralogs, and future studies should be designed to test the impact of duplication against this alternative model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) plays an increasing role in communicable disease control through high-resolution outbreak tracing, laboratory surveillance and diagnostics. However, WGS has traditionally relied on microbial culture in order to obtain pathogen specific DNA for sequencing. This has severely limited the application of whole genome sequencing on pathogens with fastidious culturing requirements. In addition, the widespread adoption of culture-independent diagnostic tests has reduced availability of cultured isolates for confirmatory testing and surveillance. These recent developments have created demand for the implementation of techniques enabling direct sequencing of microbial genomes in clinical samples without having to culture an isolate. However, sequencing of specific organisms from clinical samples can be affected by high levels of contaminating DNA from the host and other commensal microorganisms. Several methods have been introduced for selective lysis of host cells and/or separate specific organisms from a clinical sample. This review examines the different approaches for sample preparation that have been used in diagnostic and public health laboratories for metagenomic sequencing.},

The protocol begins with the preparation of the membrane protein complex, enabling not only the direct assessment of stoichiometry, delipidation and quality of the target complex but also the evaluation of the purification strategy. A detailed list of compatible nonionic detergents is included, along with a protocol for screening detergents to find an optimal one for MS, biochemical and structural studies. This protocol also covers the preparation of lipids for protein-lipid binding studies and includes detailed settings for a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer after the introduction of complexes from gold-coated nanoflow capillaries.},

abstract = {Motivation: Word embedding approaches have revolutionized Natural Lange Processing (NLP) research. These approaches aim to map words to a low-dimensional vector space in which words with similar linguistic features are close in the vector space. These NLP approaches also preserve local linguistic features, such as analogy. Embedding-based approaches have also been developed for proteins. To date, such approaches treat amino acids as words, and proteins are treated as sentences of amino acids. These approaches have been evaluated either qualitatively, via visual inspection of the embedding space, or extrinsicaly, via performance on a downstream task. However, it is difficult to directly assess the intrinsic quality of the learned embeddings. Results: In this paper, we introduce dom2vec, an approach for learning protein domain embeddings. We also present four intrinsic evaluation strategies which directly assess the quality of protein domain embeddings. We leverage the hierarchy relationship of InterPro domains, known secondary structure classes, Enzyme Commision class information, and Gene Ontology annotations in these assessments. Importantly, these evaluations allow us to assess the quality of learned embeddings independently of a particular downstream task, similar to the local linguistic features used in traditional NLP. We also show that dom2vec embeddings are competitive with, or even outperform, state-of-the-art approaches on downstream tasks.},

abstract = {The ongoing functional annotation of proteins relies upon the work of curators to capture experimental findings from scientific literature and apply them to protein sequence and structure data. However, with the increasing use of high-throughput experimental assays, a small number of experimental studies dominate the functional protein annotations collected in databases. Here, we investigate just how prevalent is the "few articles - many proteins" phenomenon. We examine the experimentally validated annotation of proteins provided by several groups in the GO Consortium, and show that the distribution of proteins per published study is exponential, with 0.14{\%} of articles providing the source of annotations for 25{\%} of the proteins in the UniProt-GOA compilation. Since each of the dominant articles describes the use of an assay that can find only one function or a small group of functions, this leads to substantial biases in what we know about the function of many proteins. Mass-spectrometry, microscopy and RNAi experiments dominate high throughput experiments. Consequently, the functional information derived from these experiments is mostly of the subcellular location of proteins, and of the participation of proteins in embryonic developmental pathways. For some organisms, the information provided by different studies overlap by a large amount. We also show that the information provided by high throughput experiments is less specific than those provided by low throughput experiments. Given the experimental techniques available, certain biases in protein function annotation due to high-throughput experiments are unavoidable. Knowing that these biases exist and understanding their characteristics and extent is important for database curators, developers of function annotation programs, and anyone who uses protein function annotation data to plan experiments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Schnoes et al.},

@article{Anderluh2003,
abstract = {Compared with folded structures, natively unfolded protein domains are over-represented in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Such domains are common features of all colicins and are required for their translocation across the outer membrane of the target Escherichia coli cell. All of these domains bind to at least one periplasmic protein of the Tol or Ton family. Similar domains are found in Ton-dependent outer membrane transporters, indicating they may interact in a related manner. In this article we have studied binding of the colicin N translocation domain to its periplasmic receptor TolA, by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using fluorescent probes attached to engineered cysteine residues and NMR techniques. The domain exhibits a random coil circular dichroism spectrum. However, FRET revealed that guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation caused increases in all measured intramolecular distances showing that, although natively unfolded, the domain is not extended. Furthermore NMR reported a compact hydrodynamic radius of 18 A. Nevertheless the FRET-derived distances changed upon binding to TolA indicating a significant structural rearrangement. Using 1H-15N NMR we show that, when bound, the peptide switches from a disordered state to an ordered state. The kinetics of binding and the associated structural change were measured by stopped-flow methods, and both events appear to occur simultaneously. The data therefore suggest that this molecular recognition involves the concerted binding and folding of a flexible but collapsed state.},

To achieve high selectivity within the crowded cellular milieu the cell utilizes scaffolding complexes whose role is to bring molecules in proximity thereby controlling and enhancing intermolecular interactions and signaling events. To date, scaffolds have been shown to be composed of proteinaceous units; however, recent evidence has supported the idea that non-coding RNAs may also play a similar role. In this Point-of-View article we discuss recent data on ncRNA scaffolds, with particular focus on ncRNA HOTAIR. Using our current knowledge of signaling networks we discuss the role that RNA may play in writing and regulating histone modifications and the information needed for correct gene expression. Further, we speculate on additional, yet undiscovered, roles that ncRNAs may be playing as molecular scaffolds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Smad proteins transduce the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signal at the cell surface into gene regulation in the nucleus. Upon TGF-beta treatment, the highly homologous Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptor at the SSXS motif in the C-terminal tail. Here we show that in addition to the C-tail, three (S/T)-P sites in the Smad3 linker region, Ser(208), Ser(204), and Thr(179) are phosphorylated in response to TGF-beta. The linker phosphorylation peaks at 1 h after TGF-beta treatment, behind the peak of the C-tail phosphorylation. We provide evidence suggesting that the C-tail phosphorylation by the TGF-beta receptor is necessary for the TGF-beta-induced linker phosphorylation. Although the TGF-beta receptor is necessary for the linker phosphorylation, the receptor itself does not phosphorylate these sites. We further show that ERK is not responsible for TGF-beta-dependent phosphorylation of these three sites. We show that GSK3 accounts for TGF-beta-inducible Ser(204) phosphorylation. Flavopiridol, a pan-CDK inhibitor, abolishes TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Thr(179) and Ser(208), suggesting that the CDK family is responsible for phosphorylation of Thr(179) and Ser(208) in response to TGF-beta. Mutation of the linker phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues increases the ability of Smad3 to activate a TGF-beta/Smad-target gene as well as the growth-inhibitory function of Smad3. Thus, these observations suggest that TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 linker sites inhibits its antiproliferative activity.},

One copy of SecA in an intermediate state of ATP hydrolysis is bound to one molecule of the SecY complex. Both partners undergo important conformational changes on interaction. The polypeptide-cross-linking domain of SecA makes a large conformational change that could capture the translocation substrate in a 'clamp'. Polypeptide movement through the SecY channel could be achieved by the motion of a 'two-helix finger' of SecA inside the cytoplasmic funnel of SecY, and by the coordinated tightening and widening of SecA's clamp above the SecY pore. SecA binding generates a 'window' at the lateral gate of the SecY channel and it displaces the plug domain, preparing the channel for signal sequence binding and channel opening.},

There is no reliable and agreed method for measuring food intake of flies in undisturbed, steady state, and normal culture conditions. We report such a method, based on measurement of feeding frequency by proboscis-extension, validated by short-term measurements of food dye intake. We used the method to demonstrate that (a) female flies feed more frequently than males, (b) flies feed more often when housed in larger groups and (c) fly feeding varies at different times of the day. We also show that alterations in food intake are not induced by dietary restriction or by a null mutation of the fly insulin receptor substrate chico. In contrast, mutation of takeout increases food intake by increasing feeding frequency while mutation of ovo(D) increases food intake by increasing the volume of food consumed per proboscis-extension. This approach provides a practical and reliable method for quantification of food intake in Drosophila under normal, undisturbed culture conditions.},

abstract = {Approximately one-half of the amino acid sequence (911 amino acid residues out of 1,880 expected) for bovine plasma fibronectin (cold-insoluble globulin) has been determined. Three types of internal homology were identified, showing that a number of partial gene duplications (multiplications) have occurred during the evolution of this protein. Digestion of fibronectin with plasmin results in major fragments with molecular masses of 29, 170, 23, and 6 kilodaltons (kDal). The NH(2)-terminal 29-kDal fragment consists of 259 residues ordered as five mutually homologous domains (type I homology) with two disulfide bonds in each domain. The 170-kDal fragment shows two to three bands after NaDodSO(4) gel electrophoresis, indicating heterogeneity. This fragment contains the gelatin binding site and the strong heparin binding site present in fibronectin. Digestion of the 170-kDal fragment with chymotrypsin liberates a 45-kDal fragment that also binds to gelatin. This fragment contains at least one domain of type I homology and two domains of type II homology. Further digestion of the 170-kDal fragment with chymotrypsin results in the formation of a 30-kDal fragment that retains the heparin binding activity. This fragment contains sequences constituting type III homology. The 23-kDal fragment consists of 178 residues having three domains of type I homology. The 6-kDal fragment consists of two identical peptides of 26 residues, and these two peptides are linked to each other by two disulfide bonds that form the interchain bridges. Another one of the peptides for which the sequence was determined links the COOH-terminus of the 29-kDal fragment to the NH(2)-terminus of the 170-kDal fragment. This and the fact that the COOH-terminal residue of the 6-kDal fragment is a glutamic acid residue order the four plasmin-digestion fragments as 29-, 170-, 23-, and 6-kDal in the intact fibronectin molecule.},

Much progress has been made in understanding the proteins involved in regulating alternative splicing, the sequences they bind to, and how these interactions lead to changes in splicing patterns. However, several recent studies have identified other players involved in regulating alternative splicing. A major theme emerging from these studies is that RNA secondary structures play an under appreciated role in the regulation of alternative splicing. This review provides an overview of the basic aspects of splicing regulation and highlights recent progress in understanding the role of RNA secondary structure in this process.},

abstract = {I have frequently been asked about many controversial issues concerning the usage of homology and related terms. I examine some of these below as a set of 15 prob-lems. This is my opinion on how best to maximize clarity on the use of these concepts with as little pain to alterna-tive views as possible. Part of that clarity lies in making sure the definitions are self consistent. There are many alternative definitions for most of these terms and it might seem that we don't need another paper discussing this. But there is so much anguish about best usage, and so much misusage by new investigators to the field, especially by molecular biologists, mathematicians and bioinformatics people, that, if this could help investigators express them-selves more clearly and get others to examine their own definitions and keep them within some bounds, it will be worth the effort. I have avoided phrases like 'I would sug-gest' and 'in my opinion' to save space. Insert them liber-ally wherever the text seems too dogmatic. Although the examples are largely molecular, the intent is to be as uni-versal as possible, and a glossary is listed in Box 1. This article is an invited follow up on the excellent paper here in 1997 (Ref. 1). Other good discussion of most of these topics can be found in Refs 2 and 3. For a comparison between molecules and morphology, see Ref. 4. Homology is the relationship of two characters that have descended, usually with divergence, from a common ancestral character. This is important because most of the terminological problems stem from different definitions of homology. Characters can be any genic, structural or behavioral feature of an organism. Analogy is distin-guished from homology in that its characters, although similar, have descended convergently from unrelated ancestral characters. The cenancestor is the most recent common ancestor of the taxa being considered 5 . The other homologies problem Organic chemists consider compounds such as methane, ethane and propane to be an homologous series because each differs from the next by a CH 2 group. Thus, homoserine has one more CH 2 group than serine. Mathematicians have special meanings for the term as well. There is no point in worrying about these differ-ences, except to suggest that molecular biologists, mathe-maticians and bioinformaticists working in the field of biology learn and adhere to the biological definitions.},

abstract = {Relative quantification methods have dominated the quantitative proteomics field. There is a need, however, to conduct absolute quantification studies to accurately model and understand the complex molecular biology that results in proteome variability among biological samples. A new method of absolute quantification of proteins is described. This method is based on the discovery of an unexpected relationship between MS signal response and protein concentration: the average MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides per mole of protein is constant within a coefficient of variation of less than +/-10{\%}. Given an internal standard, this relationship is used to calculate a universal signal response factor. The universal signal response factor (counts/mol) was shown to be the same for all proteins tested in this study. A controlled set of six exogenous proteins of varying concentrations was studied in the absence and presence of human serum. The absolute quantity of the standard proteins was determined with a relative error of less than +/-15{\%}. The average MS signal responses of the three most intense peptides from each protein were plotted against their calculated protein concentrations, and this plot resulted in a linear relationship with an R(2) value of 0.9939. The analyses were applied to determine the absolute concentration of 11 common serum proteins, and these concentrations were then compared with known values available in the literature. Additionally within an unfractionated Escherichia coli lysate, a subset of identified proteins known to exist as functional complexes was studied. The calculated absolute quantities were used to accurately determine their stoichiometry.},

abstract = {The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in natural image classification systems has produced very impressive results. Combined with the inherent nature of medical images that make them ideal for deep-learning, further application of such systems to medical image classification holds much promise. However, the usefulness and potential impact of such a system can be completely negated if it does not reach a target accuracy. In this paper, we present a study on determining the optimum size of the training data set necessary to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image classification systems. The CNN was applied to classify axial Computed Tomography (CT) images into six anatomical classes. We trained the CNN using six different sizes of training data set (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200) and then tested the resulting system with a total of 6000 CT images. All images were acquired from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Using this data, we employ the learning curve approach to predict classification accuracy at a given training sample size. Our research will present a general methodology for determining the training data set size necessary to achieve a certain target classification accuracy that can be easily applied to other problems within such systems.},

Splicing can be found in species from bacteria to humans, but its prevalence and characteristics vary considerably. Evolutionary studies are helping to address questions that are fundamental to understanding this important process: how and when did AS evolve? Which AS events are functional? What are the evolutionary forces that shaped, and continue to shape, AS? And what determines whether an exon is spliced in a constitutive or alternative manner? In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge of AS and evolution and provide insights into some of these unresolved questions.},

abstract = {A protein map of the smallest known self‐replicating organism, Mycoplasma genitalium (Class: Mollicutes), revealed a high proportion of acidic proteins. Amino acid composition was used to putatively identify, or provide unique parameters, for 50 gene products separated by two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis. A further 19 proteins were subjected to peptide‐mass fingerprinting using matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionisation‐time of flight (MALDI‐TOF) mass spectrometry and 4 were subjected to N‐terminal Edman degradation. The majority of M. genitalium proteins remain uncharacterised. However, the combined approach of amino acid analysis and peptide‐mass fingerprinting allowed gene products to be linked to homologous genes in a variety of organisms. This has allowed proteins to be identified prior to detection of their respective genes via the M. genitalium sequencing initiative. The principle of ‘hierarchical' analysis for the mass screening of proteins and the analysis of microbial genomes via their protein complement or ‘proteome' is detailed. Here, characterisation of gene products depends upon the quickest and most economical technologies being employed initially, so as to determine if a large number of proteins are already present in both homologous and heterologous species databases. Initial screening, which lends itself to automation and robotics, can then be followed by more time and cost intensive procedures, when necessary.

abstract = {Using electrostatic calculations, we have examined the dependence of the protonation state of cytochrome c oxidase from bovine heart on its redox state. Based on these calculations, we propose a possible scheme of redox-linked proton pumping. The scheme involves His291 - one of the ligands of the Cu(B) redox center - which plays the role of the proton loading site (PLS) of the pump. The mechanism of pumping is based on ET reaction between two hemes of the enzyme, which is coupled to a transfer of two protons. Upon ET, the first proton (fast reaction) is transferred to the PLS (His291), while subsequent transfer of the second "chemical" proton to the binuclear center (slow reaction) is accompanied by the ejection of the first (pumped) proton. Within the proposed model, we discuss the catalytic cycle of the enzyme.},

Despite their crucial roles in biology and their unusual trimeric subunit stoichiometry, there is little knowledge of the structural and chemical principles underlying their ion channel architecture and ion-binding sites.

We determined multiple x-ray crystal structures of the GluA2 AMPA receptor in complex with a Conus striatus cone snail toxin, a positive allosteric modulator, and orthosteric agonists, at 3.8 to 4.1 angstrom resolution. We show how the toxin acts like a straightjacket on the ligand-binding domain (LBD) "gating ring," restraining the domains via both intra- and interdimer cross-links such that agonist-induced closure of the LBD "clamshells" is transduced into an irislike expansion of the gating ring. By structural analysis of activation-enhancing mutants, we show how the expansion of the LBD gating ring results in pulling forces on the M3 helices that, in turn, are coupled to ion channel gating.},

abstract = {The widening gap between known protein sequences and their functions has led to the practice of assigning a potential function to a protein on the basis of sequence similarity to proteins whose function has been experimentally investigated. We present here a critical view of the theoretical and practical bases for this approach. The results obtained by analyzing a significant number of true sequence similarities, derived directly from structural alignments, point to the complexity of function prediction. Different aspects of protein function, including (i) enzymatic function classification, (ii) functional annotations in the form of key words, (iii) classes of cellular function, and (iv) conservation of binding sites can only be reliably transferred between similar sequences to a modest degree. The reason for this difficulty is a combination of the unavoidable database inaccuracies and the plasticity of protein function. In addition, analysis of the relationship between sequence and functional descriptions defines an empirical limit for pairwise-based functional annotations, namely, the three first digits of the six numbers used as descriptors of protein folds in the FSSP database can be predicted at an average level as low as 7.5{\%} sequence identity, two of the four EC digits at 15{\%} identity, half of the SWISS-PROT key words related to protein function would require 20{\%} identity, and the prediction of half of the residues in the binding site can be made at the 30{\%} sequence identity level.},

In that time, there has also been a proliferation of both sequencing platforms and approaches to analyse their output. This requires approaches to assess the performance of different methods. Traditionally, criteria such as comparison with microarray data or a number of known polymorphic sites have been used. Here we expand such approaches, developing a maximum likelihood framework and using it to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-exome sequencing data.

RESULTS:: Using whole-exome sequencing data for a panel of 19 individuals, we show that estimated sensitivity and specificity are similar to those calculated using microarray data as a reference. We explore the effect of frequency misspecification arising from using an inappropriately selected population and find that, although the estimates are affected, the rankings across procedures remain the same.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding and predicting the effects of mutations on protein structure and phenotype is an increasingly important area. Genes for many genetically linked diseases are now routinely sequenced in the clinic. Previously we focused on understanding the structural effects of mutations, creating the SAAPdb resource. RESULTS: We have updated SAAPdb to include 41{\%} more SNPs and 36{\%} more PDs. Introducing a hydrophobic residue on the surface, or a hydrophilic residue in the core, no longer shows significant differences between SNPs and PDs. We have improved some of the analyses significantly enhancing the analysis of clashes and of mutations to-proline and from-glycine. A new web interface has been developed allowing users to analyze their own mutations. Finally we have developed a machine learning method which gives a cross-validated accuracy of 0.846, considerably out-performing well known methods including SIFT and PolyPhen2 which give accuracies between 0.690 and 0.785. CONCLUSIONS: We have updated SAAPdb and improved its analyses, but with the increasing rate with which mutation data are generated, we have created a new analysis pipeline and web interface. Results of machine learning using the structural analysis results to predict pathogenicity considerably outperform other methods.},

abstract = {The lifetimes of activated postsynaptic receptor channels contribute to the efficiency of synaptic transmission. Here we show that structural differences within the interface dividing extracellular and transmembrane domains of homomeric alpha7 and 5-HT(3A) receptors account for the large differences in open-channel lifetime and time of desensitization onset between these contrasting members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. For alpha7 receptors, agonist-evoked single-channel currents appear mainly as isolated brief openings (tau(o) = 0.35 ms), whereas macroscopic currents after a step pulse of agonist desensitize rapidly (tau(d) = 0.4 ms). In contrast for 5-HT(3A) receptors, agonist-evoked single-channel currents appear as clusters of many long openings in quick succession (tau(cluster) = 1.2 s), whereas macroscopic currents desensitize slowly (tau(d) = 1.1 s). A chimeric alpha7-5HT(3A) receptor exhibits functional properties intermediate between those of the parent receptors, but the functional signatures of each parent are reconstituted after substituting the major loops within the interface of the extracellular and transmembrane domains from the corresponding parent receptor. Furthermore, these structural loops contribute to open-channel lifetime and time of desensitization onset in a nonadditive manner. The results suggest that desensitization is the major determinant of the lifetimes of activated alpha7 and 5-HT(3A) receptors and that functional differences between the two receptors arise primarily through structural differences at the interface between extracellular and transmembrane domains.},

abstract = {This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},

abstract = {Background: Protein-protein interactions(PPIs) engage in dynamic pathological and biological procedures constantly in our life. Thus, it is crucial to comprehend the PPIs thoroughly such that we are able to illuminate the disease occurrence, achieve the optimal drug-target therapeutic effect and describe the protein complex structures. However, compared to the protein sequences obtainable from various species and organisms, the number of revealed protein-protein interactions is relatively limited. To address this dilemma, lots of research endeavor have investigated in it to facilitate the discovery of novel PPIs. Among these methods, PPI prediction techniques that merely rely on protein sequence data are more widespread than other methods which require extensive biological domain knowledge. Results: In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep representation learning structure by incorporating protein physicochemical features with the graph topological features from the PPI networks. Specifically, our method not only bears in mind the protein sequence information but also discerns the topological representations for each protein node in the PPI networks. In our paper, we construct a stacked auto-encoder architecture together with a continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model based on generated metapaths to study the PPI predictions. Following by that, we utilize the supervised deep neural networks to identify the PPIs and classify the protein families. The PPI prediction accuracy for eight species ranged from 96.76{\%} to 99.77{\%}, which signifies that our multi-modal deep representation learning framework achieves superior performance compared to other computational methods. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal deep representation learning framework for examining the PPI networks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license Lowered activity of the insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network can ameliorate the effects of ageing in laboratory animals and, possibly, humans. Although transcriptome remodelling in long-lived IIS mutants has been extensively documented, the causal mechanisms contributing to extended lifespan, particularly in specific tissues, remain unclear. We have characterized the proteomes of four key insulin-sensitive tissues in a long-lived Drosophila IIS mutant and control, and detected 44{\%} of the predicted proteome (6,085 proteins). Expression of ribosome-associated proteins in the fat body was reduced in the mutant, with a corresponding, tissue-specific reduction in translation. Expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins in fat body was increased, leading to increased respiration, which was necessary for IIS-mediated lifespan extension, and alone sufficient to mediate it. Proteasomal subunits showed altered expression in IIS mutant gut, and gut-specific over-expression of the RPN6 proteasomal subunit, was sufficient to increase proteasomal activity and extend lifespan, whilst inhibition of proteasome activity abolished IIS-mediated longevity. Our study thus uncovered strikingly tissue-specific responses of cellular processes to lowered IIS acting in concert to ameliorate ageing.},

abstract = {Behavior involves the ongoing interaction between an organism and its environment. One of the prevailing theories of adaptive behavior is that organisms are constantly making predictions about their future environmental stimuli. However, how they acquire that predictive information is still poorly understood. Two complementary mechanisms have been proposed: predictions are generated from an agent's internal model of the world or predictions are extracted directly from the environmental stimulus. In this work, we demonstrate that predictive information, measured using bivariate mutual information, cannot distinguish between these two kinds of systems. Furthermore, we show that predictive information cannot distinguish between organisms that are adapted to their environments and random dynamical systems exposed to the same environment. To understand the role of predictive information in adaptive behavior, we need to be able to identify where it is generated. To do this, we decompose information transfer across the different components of the organism-environment system and track the flow of information in the system over time. To validate the proposed framework, we examined it on a set of computational models of idealized agent-environment systems. Analysis of the systems revealed three key insights. First, predictive information, when sourced from the environment, can be reflected in any agent irrespective of its ability to perform a task. Second, predictive information, when sourced from the nervous system, requires special dynamics acquired during the process of adapting to the environment. Third, the magnitude of predictive information in a system can be different for the same task if the environmental structure changes.},

abstract = {A protein's amino acid sequence dictates the folds and final structure the macromolecule will form. We propose that by identifying critical residues in a protein's atomic structure, we can select a critical stability framework within the protein structure essential to proper protein folding. We use global computational mutagenesis based on the unfolding mutation screen to test the effect of every possible missense mutation on the protein structure to identify the residues that cannot tolerate a substitution without causing protein misfolding. This method was tested using molecular dynamics to simulate the stability effects of mutating critical residues in proteins involved in inherited disease, such as myoglobin, p53, and the 15th sushi domain of complement factor H. In addition we prove that when the critical residues are in place, other residues may be changed within the structure without a stability loss. We validate that critical residues are conserved using myoglobin to show that critical residues are the same for crystal structures of 6 different species and comparing conservation indices to critical residues in 9 eye disease-related proteins. Our studies demonstrate that by using a selection of critical elements in a protein structure we can identify a critical protein stability framework. The frame of critical residues can be used in genetic engineering to improve small molecule binding for drug studies, identify loss-of-function disease-causing missense mutations in genetics studies, and aide in identifying templates for homology modeling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: S-glutathionylation is the formation of disulfide bonds between the tripeptide glutathione and cysteine residues of the protein, protecting them from irreversible oxidation and in some cases causing change in their functions. Regulatory glutathionylation of proteins is a controllable and reversible process associated with cell response to the changing redox status. Prediction of cysteine residues that undergo glutathionylation allows us to find new target proteins, which function can be altered in pathologies associated with impaired redox status. We set out to analyze this issue and create new tool for predicting S-glutathionylated cysteine residues. RESULTS: One hundred forty proteins with experimentally proven S-glutathionylated cysteine residues were found in the literature and the RedoxDB database. These proteins contain 1018 non-S-glutathionylated cysteines and 235 S-glutathionylated ones. Based on 235 S-glutathionylated cysteines, non-redundant positive dataset of 221 heptapeptide sequences of S-glutathionylated cysteines was made. Based on 221 heptapeptide sequences, a position-specific matrix was created by analyzing the protein sequence near the cysteine residue (three amino acid residues before and three after the cysteine). We propose the method for calculating the glutathionylation propensity score, which utilizes the position-specific matrix and a criterion for predicting glutathionylated peptides. CONCLUSION: Non-S-glutathionylated sites were enriched by cysteines in - 3 and + 3 positions. The proposed prediction method demonstrates 76.6{\%} of correct predictions of S-glutathionylated cysteines. This method can be used for detecting new glutathionylation sites, especially in proteins with an unknown structure.},

@article{Treiber2020,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shotgun metagenomes are often assembled prior to annotation of genes  which biases the functional capacity of a community towards its most abundant members. For an unbiased assessment of community function, short reads need to be mapped directly to a gene or protein database. The ability to detect genes in short read sequences is dependent on pre- and post-sequencing decisions. The objective of the current study was to determine how library size selection, read length and format, protein database, e-value threshold, and sequencing depth impact gene-centric analysis of human fecal microbiomes when using DIAMOND, an alignment tool that is up to 20,000 times faster than BLASTX. RESULTS: Using metagenomes simulated from a database of experimentally verified protein sequences, we find that read length, e-value threshold, and the choice of protein database dramatically impact detection of a known target, with best performance achieved with longer reads, stricter e-value thresholds, and a custom database. Using publicly available metagenomes, we evaluated library size selection, paired end read strategy, and sequencing depth. Longer read lengths were acheivable by merging paired ends when the sequencing library was size-selected to enable overlaps. When paired ends could not be merged, a congruent strategy in which both ends are independently mapped was acceptable. Sequencing depths of 5 million merged reads minimized the error of abundance estimates of specific target genes, including an antimicrobial resistance gene. CONCLUSIONS: Shotgun metagenomes of DNA extracted from human fecal samples sequenced using the Illumina platform should be size-selected to enable merging of paired end reads and should be sequenced in the PE150 format with a minimum sequencing depth of 5 million merge-able reads to enable detection of specific target genes. Expecting the merged reads to be 180-250 bp in length, the appropriate e-value threshold for DIAMOND would then need to be more strict than the default. Accurate and interpretable results for specific hypotheses will be best obtained using small databases customized for the research question.},

abstract = {The functional diversity of kinases enables specificity in cellular signal transduction. Yet how more than 500 members of the human kinome specifically receive regulatory inputs and convey information to appropriate substrates-all while using the common signaling output of phosphorylation-remains enigmatic. Here, we perform statistical co-evolution analysis, mutational scanning, and quantitative live-cell assays to reveal a hierarchical organization of the kinase domain that facilitates the orthogonal evolution of regulatory inputs and substrate outputs while maintaining catalytic function. We find that three quasi-independent "sectors"-groups of evolutionarily coupled residues-represent functional units in the kinase domain that encode for catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and regulation. Sector positions impact both disease and pharmacology: the catalytic sector is significantly enriched for somatic cancer mutations, and residues in the regulatory sector interact with allosteric kinase inhibitors. We propose that this functional architecture endows the kinase domain with inherent regulatory plasticity.},

abstract = {The lack of a deep understanding of how proteins interact remains an important roadblock in advancing efforts to identify binding partners and uncover the corresponding regulatory mechanisms of the functions they mediate. Understanding protein-protein interactions is also essential for designing specific chemical modifications to develop new reagents and therapeutics. We explored the hypothesis of whether protein interaction sites serve as generic biding sites for non-cognate protein ligands, just as it has been observed for small-molecule-binding sites in the past. Using extensive computational docking experiments on a test set of 241 protein complexes, we found that indeed there is a strong preference for non-cognate ligands to bind to the cognate binding site of a receptor. This observation appears to be robust to variations in docking programs, types of non-cognate protein probes, sizes of binding patches, relative sizes of binding patches and full-length proteins, and the exploration of obligate and non-obligate complexes. The accuracy of the docking scoring function appears to play a role in defining the correct site. The frequency of interaction of unrelated probes recognizing the binding interface was utilized in a simple prediction algorithm that showed accuracy competitive with other state of the art methods.},

abstract = {Small proteins are traditionally overlooked due to computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe {\textgreater}4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ∼30{\%} of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90{\%} of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported. Computational identification and characterization of thousands of conserved small ORFs from human microbiome sequences spanning multiple anatomical sites suggests a diversity of unknown protein domains and families with diverse functions.},

abstract = {Disease modules in molecular interaction maps have been useful for characterizing diseases. Yet biological networks, that commonly define such modules are incomplete and biased toward some well-studied disease genes. Here we ask whether disease-relevant modules of genes can be discovered without prior knowledge of a biological network, instead training a deep autoencoder from large transcriptional data. We hypothesize that modules could be discovered within the autoencoder representations. We find a statistically significant enrichment of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relevant genes in the last layer, and to a successively lesser degree in the middle and first layers respectively. In contrast, we find an opposite gradient where a modular protein–protein interaction signal is strongest in the first layer, but then vanishing smoothly deeper in the network. We conclude that a data-driven discovery approach is sufficient to discover groups of disease-related genes.},

abstract = {Cancer is a complex disease of multiple alterations occuring at the epigenomic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and/or metabolic levels. The contribution of genetic mutations in cancer initiation, progression and evolution is well understood. However, although metabolic changes in cancer have long been acknowledged and considered a plausible therapeutic target, the crosstalk between genetic and metabolic alterations throughout cancer types is not clearly defined. In this review, we summarise the present understanding of the interactions between genetic drivers of cellular transformation and cancer-associated metabolic changes, and how these interactions contribute to metabolic heterogeneity of tumours. We discuss the essential question of whether changes in metabolism are a cause or a consequence in the formation of cancer. We highlight two modes of how metabolism contributes to tumour formation. One is when metabolic reprogramming occurs downstream of oncogenic mutations in signalling pathways and supports tumorigenesis. The other is where metabolic reprogramming initiates transformation being either downstream of mutations in oncometabolite genes or induced by chronic wounding, inflammation, oxygen stress or metabolic diseases. Finally, we focus on the factors that can contribute to metabolic heterogeneity in tumours, including genetic heterogeneity, immunomodulatory factors and tissue architecture. We believe that an in-depth understanding of cancer metabolic reprogramming, and the role of metabolic dysregulation in tumour initiation and progression, can help identify cellular vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic use.},

abstract = {The identification of interactions between drugs/compounds and their targets is crucial for the development of new drugs. In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as 'virtual screening' (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and bench-marking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions.

abstract = {Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes critical for an organism's function will be depleted for such variants in natural populations, while non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes. Here, we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence pLoF variants in this cohort after filtering for sequencing and annotation artifacts. Using an improved human mutation rate model, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum representing tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve gene discovery power for both common and rare diseases.},

@article{Grassmann2020,
abstract = {Genes involved in cancer are under constant evolutionary pressure, potentially resulting in diverse molecular properties. In this study, we explore 23 omic features from publicly available databases to define the molecular profile of different classes of cancer genes. Cancer genes were grouped according to mutational landscape (germline and somatically mutated genes), role in cancer initiation (cancer driver genes) or cancer survival (survival genes), as well as being implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS genes). For each gene, we also computed feature scores based on all omic features, effectively summarizing how closely a gene resembles cancer genes of the respective class. In general, cancer genes are longer, have a lower GC content, have more isoforms with shorter exons, are expressed in more tissues and have more transcription factor binding sites than non-cancer genes. We found that germline genes more closely resemble single tissue GWAS genes while somatic genes are more similar to pleiotropic cancer GWAS genes. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized aggregated feature scores to prioritize genes in breast cancer GWAS loci and found that top ranking genes were enriched in cancer related pathways. In conclusion, we have identified multiple omic features associated with different classes of cancer genes, which can assist prioritization of genes in cancer gene discovery.},

abstract = {Mutation-specific effects of cancer driver genes influence drug responses and the success of clinical trials. We reasoned that these effects could unbalance the distribution of each mutation across different cancer types, as a result, the cancer preference can be used to distinguish the effects of the causal mutation. Here, we developed a network-based framework to systematically measure cancer diversity for each driver mutation. We found that half of the driver genes harbor cancer type-specific and pancancer mutations simultaneously, suggesting that the pervasive functional heterogeneity of the mutations from even the same driver gene. We further demonstrated that the specificity of the mutations could influence patient drug responses. Moreover, we observed that diversity was generally increased in advanced tumors. Finally, we scanned potentially novel cancer driver genes based on the diversity spectrum. Diversity spectrum analysis provides a new approach to define driver mutations and optimize off-label clinical trials.},

abstract = {Many high-throughput experimental technologies have been developed to assess the effects of large numbers of mutations (variation) on phenotypes. However, designing functional assays for these methods is challenging, and systematic testing of all combinations is impossible, so robust methods to predict the effects of genetic variation are needed. Most prediction methods exploit evolutionary sequence conservation but do not consider the interdependencies of residues or bases. We present EVmutation, an unsupervised statistical method for predicting the effects of mutations that explicitly captures residue dependencies between positions. We validate EVmutation by comparing its predictions with outcomes of high-throughput mutagenesis experiments and measurements of human disease mutations and show that it outperforms methods that do not account for epistasis. EVmutation can be used to assess the quantitative effects of mutations in genes of any organism. We provide pre-computed predictions for ∼7,000 human proteins at http://evmutation.org/.},

abstract = {Protein kinases represent one of the largest gene families in eukaryotes and play roles in a wide range of cell signaling processes and human diseases. Current tools for visualizing kinase data in the context of the human kinome superfamily are limited to encoding data through the addition of nodes to a low-resolution image of the kinome tree. We present Coral, a user-friendly interactive web application for visualizing both quantitative and qualitative data. Unlike previous tools, Coral can encode data in three features (node color, node size, and branch color), allows three modes of kinome visualization (the traditional kinome tree as well as radial and dynamic force networks), and generates high-resolution scalable vector graphics files suitable for publication without the need for refinement using graphics editing software. Due to its user-friendly, interactive, and highly customizable design, Coral is broadly applicable to high-throughput studies of the human kinome.

To date, there is no treatment for coronavirus infections, making the development of therapies to prevent future epidemics of paramount importance. To this end, we collected information regarding naturally-occurring variants of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an epithelial receptor that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use to enter the host cells. We built 242 structural models of variants of human ACE2 bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) and refined their interfaces with HADDOCK. Our dataset includes 140 variants of human ACE2 representing missense mutations found in genome-wide studies, 39 mutants with reported effects on the recognition of the RBD, and 63 predictions after computational alanine scanning mutagenesis of ACE2-RBD interface residues. This dataset will help accelerate the design of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, as well as contribute to prevention of possible future coronaviruses outbreaks.},

abstract = {Global insights into cellular organization and function require comprehensive understanding of interactome networks. Similar to how a reference genome sequence revolutionized human genetics, a reference map of the human interactome network is critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here we present the first human “all-by-all” binary reference interactome map, or “HuRI”. With {\~{}}53,000 high-quality protein-protein interactions (PPIs), HuRI is approximately four times larger than the information curated from small-scale studies available in the literature. Integrating HuRI with genome, transcriptome and proteome data enables the study of cellular function within essentially any physiological or pathological cellular context. We demonstrate the use of HuRI in identifying specific subcellular roles of PPIs and protein function modulation via splicing during brain development. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI thus represents an unprecedented, systematic reference linking genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.},

abstract = {Computer simulation provides an increasingly realistic picture of large-scale conformational change of proteins, but investigations remain fundamentally constrained by the femtosecond timestep of molecular dynamics simulations. For this reason, many biologically interesting questions cannot be addressed using accessible state-of-the-art computational resources. Here, we report the development of an all-atom Monte Carlo approach that permits the modelling of the large-scale conformational change of proteins using standard off-the-shelf computational hardware and standard all-atom force fields. We demonstrate extensive thermodynamic characterization of the folding process of the $\alpha$-helical Trp-cage, the Villin headpiece and the $\beta$-sheet WW-domain. We fully characterize the free energy landscape, transition states, energy barriers between different states, and the per-residue stability of individual amino acids over a wide temperature range. We demonstrate that a state-of-the-art intramolecular force field can be combined with an implicit solvent model to obtain a high quality of the folded structures and also discuss limitations that still remain.},

abstract = {One of the key challenges of cancer biology is to catalogue and understand the somatic genomic alterations leading to cancer. Although alternative definitions and search methods have been developed to identify cancer driver genes and mutations, analyses of thousands of cancer genomes return a remarkably similar catalogue of around 300 genes that are mutated in at least one cancer type. Yet, many features of these genes and their role in cancer remain unclear, first and foremost when a somatic mutation is truly oncogenic. In this review, we first summarize some of the recent efforts in completing the catalogue of cancer driver genes. Then, we give an overview of different aspects that influence the oncogenicity of somatic mutations in the core cancer driver genes, including their interactions with the germline genome, other cancer driver mutations, the immune system or their potential role in healthy tissues. In coming years, this research holds promise to illuminate how, when and why cancer driver genes and mutations are really drivers, and thereby move personalized cancer medicine and targeted therapies forward.

abstract = {Arthritis is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) yet understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains incomplete. We, therefore, interrogated gene expression profiles of SLE synovium to gain insight into the nature of lupus arthritis (LA), using osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as comparators. Knee synovia from SLE, OA, and RA patients were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and also by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of highly co-expressed genes. Genes upregulated and/or co-expressed in LA revealed numerous immune/inflammatory cells dominated by a myeloid phenotype, in which pathogenic macrophages, myeloid-lineage cells, and their secreted products perpetuate inflammation, whereas OA was characterized by fibroblasts and RA of lymphocytes. Genes governing trafficking of immune cells into the synovium by chemokines were identified, but not in situ generation of germinal centers (GCs). Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) confirmed activation of specific immune cell types in LA. Numerous therapies were predicted to target LA, including TNF, NF$\kappa$B, MAPK, and CDK inhibitors. Detailed gene expression analysis identified a unique pattern of cellular components and physiologic pathways operative in LA, as well as drugs potentially able to target this common manifestation of SLE.},

abstract = {0 0 m o n t h 2 0 1 7 | V o L 0 0 0 | n A t U R E | 1 To understand why molecular evolution turned out as it did, we must characterize not only the path that evolution followed across the space of possible molecular sequences but also the many alternative trajectories that could have been taken but were not. A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events 1 ; it would also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space shaped historical evolution 2,3 . Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction 4 with deep mutational scanning 5–10 to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel biological function through well-characterized mechanisms 11,12 . We find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events. We applied deep mutational scanning to the DNA-binding domain of a reconstructed ancestral steroid hormone receptor, whose historical trajectory of functional, genetic, and biochemical evolution is well understood. Steroid receptors are transcription factors that mediate the action of sex and adrenal steroids by binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating expression of target genes. The two major clades of receptors differ in their DNA specificity (Fig. 1a): oestrogen receptors prefer an inverted palindrome of AGGTCA (oestrogen response element, ERE) 13},

abstract = {The catalog of cancer driver mutations in protein-coding genes has greatly expanded in the past decade. However, non-coding cancer driver mutations are less well-characterized and only a handful of recurrent non-coding mutations, most notably TERT promoter mutations, have been reported. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancer across 38 tumor types, we perform multi-faceted pathway and network analyses of non-coding mutations across 2583 whole cancer genomes from 27 tumor types compiled by the ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project that was motivated by the success of pathway and network analyses in prioritizing rare mutations in protein-coding genes. While few non-coding genomic elements are recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identify 93 genes harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4. We find that biological processes had variable proportions of coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations, while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing is primarily altered by non-coding mutations in this cohort, and samples containing non-coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing factors exhibit similar gene expression signatures as samples with coding mutations in these genes. These analyses contribute a new repertoire of possible cancer genes and mechanisms that are altered by non-coding mutations and offer insights into additional cancer vulnerabilities that can be investigated for potential therapeutic treatments.},

abstract = {The algorithm behind particle methods is extremely versatile and used in a variety of applications that range from molecular dynamics to astrophysics. For continuum mechanics applications, the concept of ‘particle' can be generalized to include discrete portions of solid and liquid matter. This study shows that it is possible to further extend the concept of ‘particle' to include artificial neurons used in Artificial Intelligence. This produces a new class of computational methods based on ‘particle-neuron duals' that combines the ability of computational particles to model physical systems and the ability of artificial neurons to learn from data. The method is validated with a multiphysics model of the intestine that autonomously learns how to coordinate its contractions to propel the luminal content forward (peristalsis). Training is achieved with Deep Reinforcement Learning. The particle-neuron duality has the advantage of extending particle methods to systems where the underlying physics is only partially known, but we have observations that allow us to empirically describe the missing features in terms of reward function. During the simulation, the model evolves autonomously adapting its response to the available observations, while remaining consistent with the known physics of the system.},

abstract = {Allosteric regulation, the most direct and efficient way of regulating protein function, is induced by the binding of a ligand at one site that is topographically distinct from an orthosteric site. Allosteric Database (ASD, available online at http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD) has been developed to provide comprehensive information featuring allosteric regulation. With increasing data, fundamental questions pertaining to allostery are currently receiving more attention from the mechanism of allosteric changes in an individual protein to the entire effect of the changes in the interconnected network in the cell. Thus, the following novel features were added to this updated version: (i) structural mechanisms of more than 1600 allosteric actions were elucidated by a comparison of site structures before and after the binding of an modulator; (ii) 261 allosteric networks were identified to unveil how the allosteric action in a single protein would propagate to affect downstream proteins; (iii) two of the largest human allosteromes, protein kinases and GPCRs, were thoroughly constructed; and (iv) web interface and data organization were completely redesigned for efficient access. In addition, allosteric data have largely expanded in this update. These updates are useful for facilitating the investigation of allosteric mechanisms, dynamic networks and drug discoveries.},

Appropriate algorithmic solutions are required to handle increasingly common large graph data sets containing up to billions of connections. We describe the methodology applied to develop scalable solutions to network analysis problems, including techniques like parallelization, heuristics for computationally expensive problems, efficient data structures, and modular software architecture. Our goal for the software is to package results of our algorithm engineering efforts and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is implemented as a hybrid combining the kernels written in C++ with a Python frontend, enabling integration into the Python ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis and scientific computing. The package provides a wide range of functionality (including common and novel analytics algorithms and graph generators) and does so via a convenient interface. In an experimental comparison with related software, NetworKit shows the best performance on a range of typical analysis tasks.},

abstract = {Nucleotide variants can cause functional changes by altering protein-RNA binding in various ways that are not easy to predict. This can affect processes such as splicing, nuclear shuttling, and stability of the transcript. Therefore, correct modeling of protein-RNA binding is critical when predicting the effects of sequence variations. Many RNA-binding proteins recognize a diverse set of motifs and binding is typically also dependent on the genomic context, making this task particularly challenging. Here, we present DeepCLIP, the first method for context-aware modeling and predicting protein binding to RNA nucleic acids using exclusively sequence data as input. We show that DeepCLIP outperforms existing methods for modeling RNA-protein binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that DeepCLIP predictions correlate with the functional outcomes of nucleotide variants in independent wet lab experiments. Furthermore, we show how DeepCLIP binding profiles can be used in the design of therapeutically relevant antisense oligonucleotides, and to uncover possible position-dependent regulation in a tissue-specific manner. DeepCLIP is freely available as a stand-alone application and as a webtool at http://deepclip.compbio.sdu.dk.},

abstract = {Increasingly available genomic sequencing data are exploited to identify genes and variants contributing to diseases, particularly cancer. Traditionally, methods to find such variants have relied heavily on allele frequency and/or familial history, often neglecting to consider any mechanistic understanding of their functional consequences. Thus, while the set of known cancer-related genes has increased, for many, their mechanistic role in the disease is not completely understood. This issue highlights a wide gap between the disciplines of genetics, which largely aims to correlate genetic events with phenotype, and molecular biology, which ultimately aims at a mechanistic understanding of biological processes. Fortunately, new methods and several systematic studies have proved illuminating for many disease genes and variants by integrating sequencing with mechanistic data, including biomolecular structures and interactions. These have provided new interpretations for known mutations and suggested new disease relevant variants and genes. Here, we review these approaches and discuss particular examples where these have had a profound impact on the understanding of human cancers. This article is protected by copyright.

Their employment to investigate the effect of mutational changes in genes encoding for proteins modulating the membrane of excitable cells, whose biological correlates are assessed at electrophysiological level, could provide useful predictive clues. We apply this concept to the analysis of variants in sodium channel NaV1.7 subunit found in patients with chronic painful syndromes, by the implementation of a dedicated computational pipeline empowering different and complementary techniques including homology modeling, network theory, and machine learning. By testing three templates of different origin and sequence identities, we provide an optimal condition for its use.

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by virus binding to ACE2 cell surface receptors1–4, followed by fusion of virus and cell membranes to release the virus genome into the cell. Both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities are mediated by the virus Spike glycoprotein, S5–7. As with other class I membrane fusion proteins, S is post-translationally cleaved, in this case by furin, into S1 and S2 components that remain associated following cleavage8–10. Fusion activation following receptor binding is proposed to involve the exposure of a second proteolytic site (S2'), cleavage of which is required for the fusion peptide release11,12. We have investigated the binding of ACE2 to the furin-cleaved form of SARS-CoV-2 S by cryoEM. We classify ten different molecular species including the unbound, closed spike trimer, the fully open ACE2-bound trimer, and dissociated monomeric S1 bound to ACE2. The ten structures describe ACE2 binding events which destabilise the spike trimer, progressively opening up, and out, the individual S1 components. The opening process reduces S1 contacts and un-shields the trimeric S2 core, priming fusion activation and dissociation of ACE2-bound S1 monomers. The structures also reveal refolding of an S1 subdomain following ACE2 binding, that disrupts interactions with S2, notably involving Asp61413–15, leading to destabilisation of the structure of S2 proximal to the secondary (S2') cleavage site.},

Different genetic instability processes result in characteristic non-random patterns of DNA mutations, also known as mutational signatures. We developed mutSignatures, an integrated R-based computational framework aimed at deciphering DNA mutational signatures. Our software provides advanced functions for importing DNA variants, computing mutation types, and extracting mutational signatures via non-negative matrix factorization. Specifically, mutSignatures accepts multiple types of input data, is compatible with non-human genomes, and supports the analysis of non-standard mutation types, such as tetra-nucleotide mutation types. We applied mutSignatures to analyze somatic mutations found in smoking-related cancer datasets. We characterized mutational signatures that were consistent with those reported before in independent investigations. Our work demonstrates that selected mutational signatures correlated with specific clinical and molecular features across different cancer types, and revealed complementarity of specific mutational patterns that has not previously been identified. In conclusion, we propose mutSignatures as a powerful open-source tool for detecting the molecular determinants of cancer and gathering insights into cancer biology and treatment.},

abstract = {Cancer genome sequencing has shown that driver genes can often be distinguished not only by the elevated mutation frequency but also by specific nucleotide positions that accumulate changes at a high rate. However, properties associated with a residue's potential to drive tumorigenesis when mutated have not yet been systematically investigated. Here, using a novel methodological approach, we identify and characterize a compendium of 180 hotspot residues within 160 human proteins which occur with a significant frequency and are likely to have functionally relevant impact. We find that such mutations (i) are more prominent in proteins that can exist in the on and off state, (ii) reflect the identity of a tumor of origin, and (iii) often localize within interfaces which mediate interactions with other proteins or ligands. Following, we further examine structural data for human protein complexes and identify a number of additional protein interfaces that accumulate cancer mutations at a high rate. Jointly, these analyses suggest that disruption and dysregulation of protein interactions can be instrumental in switching functions of cancer proteins and activating downstream changes.},

The number and diversity of these PBDs (over 1,800 are known), their low binding affinities and the sensitivity of binding properties to minor sequence variation represent a substantial challenge to experimental and computational analysis of PBD specificity and the networks PBDs create. Here, we introduce a bespoke machine-learning approach, hierarchical statistical mechanical modeling (HSM), capable of accurately predicting the affinities of PBD–peptide interactions across multiple protein families. By synthesizing biophysical priors within a modern machine-learning framework, HSM outperforms existing computational methods and high-throughput experimental assays. HSM models are interpretable in familiar biophysical terms at three spatial scales: the energetics of protein–peptide binding, the multidentate organization of protein–protein interactions and the global architecture of signaling networks.},

If used in their entirety and provided at a high structural level, these data can be directed into constantly increasing databases which bear an enormous potential to serve as a basis for machine learning technologies with the goal to support research and healthcare with predictions of clinically relevant traits. We have developed the Cancer Systems Biology Database (CancerSysDB), a resource for highly flexible queries and analysis of cancer-related data across multiple data types and multiple studies. The CancerSysDB can be adopted by any center for the organization of their locally acquired data and its integration with publicly available data from multiple studies. A publicly available main instance of the CancerSysDB can be used to obtain highly flexible queries across multiple data types as shown by highly relevant use cases. In addition, we demonstrate how the CancerSysDB can be used for predictive cancer classification based on whole-exome data from 9091 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network.

abstract = {In this paper, we systematically review weighted persistent homology (WPH) models and their applications in biomolecular data analysis. Essentially, the weight value, which reflects physical, chemical and biological properties, can be assigned to vertices (atom centers), edges (bonds), or higher order simplexes (cluster of atoms), depending on the biomolecular structure, function, and dynamics properties. Further, we propose the first localized weighted persistent homology (LWPH). Inspired by the great success of element specific persistent homology (ESPH), we do not treat biomolecules as an inseparable system like all previous weighted models, instead we decompose them into a series of local domains, which may be overlapped with each other. The general persistent homology or weighted persistent homology analysis is then applied on each of these local domains. In this way, functional properties, that are embedded in local structures, can be revealed. Our model has been applied to systematically studying DNA structures. It has been found that our LWPH based features can be used to successfully discriminate the A-, B-, and Z-types of DNA. More importantly, our LWPH based PCA model can identify two configurational states of DNA structure in ion liquid environment, which can be revealed only by the complicated helical coordinate system. The great consistence with the helical-coordinate model demonstrates that our model captures local structure variations so well that it is comparable with geometric models. Moreover, geometric measurements are usually defined in very local regions. For instance, the helical-coordinate system is limited to one or two basepairs. However, our LWPH can quantitatively characterize structure information in local regions or domains with arbitrary sizes and shapes, where traditional geometrical measurements fail.},

However, the predominant way of identifying DE genes is to use arbitrary threshold fold or expression changes as cutoff. Here, we developed a more objective method, Scatter Overlay or ScatLay, to extract and graphically visualize DE genes across any two samples by utilizing their pair-wise scatter or transcriptome-wide noise, while factoring replicate variabilities. We tested ScatLay for 3 cell types: between time points for Escherichia coli aerobiosis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae hypoxia, and between untreated and Etomoxir treated Mus Musculus embryonic stem cell. As a result, we obtain 1194, 2061 and 2932 DE genes, respectively. Next, we compared these data with two widely used current approaches (DESeq2 and NOISeq) with typical twofold expression changes threshold, and show that ScatLay reveals significantly larger number of DE genes. Hence, our method provides a wider coverage of DE genes, and will likely pave way for finding more novel regulatory genes in future works.},

Sequencing data from a single biopsy represent a snapshot of this process that can reveal the timing of specific genomic aberrations and the changing influence of mutational processes3. Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4, we reconstruct the life history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40{\%} of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection. Whole-genome sequencing data for 2,778 cancer samples from 2,658 unique donors across 38 cancer types is used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer, revealing that driver mutations can precede diagnosis by several years to decades.},

abstract = {Understanding the functions carried out by network subgraphs is important to revealing the organizing principles of diverse complex networks. Here, we study this question in the context of collaborative problem-solving, which is central to a variety of domains from engineering and medicine to economics and social planning. We analyze the frequency of all three- and four-node subgraphs in diverse real problem-solving networks. The results reveal a strong association between a dynamic property of network subgraphs—synchronizability—and the frequency and significance of these subgraphs in problem-solving networks. In particular, we show that highly-synchronizable subgraphs are overrepresented in the networks, while poorly-synchronizable subgraphs are underrepresented, suggesting that dynamical properties affect their prevalence, and thus the global structure of networks. We propose the possibility that selective pressures that favor more synchronizable subgraphs could account for their abundance in problem-solving networks. The empirical results also show that unrelated problem-solving networks display very similar local network structure, implying that network subgraphs could represent organizational routines that enable better coordination and control of problem-solving activities. The findings could also have potential implications in understanding the functionality of network subgraphs in other information-processing networks, including biological and social networks.},

abstract = {PubMed is an essential resource for the medical domain, but useful concepts are either difficult to extract or are ambiguated, which has significantly hindered knowledge discovery. To address this issue, we constructed a PubMed knowledge graph (PKG) by extracting bio-entities from 29 million PubMed abstracts, disambiguating author names, integrating funding data through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ExPORTER, collecting affiliation history and educational background of authors from ORCID, and identifying fine-grained affiliation data from MapAffil. Through the integration of the credible multi-source data, we could create connections among the bio-entities, authors, articles, affiliations, and funding. Data validation revealed that the BioBERT deep learning method of bio-entity extraction significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art models based on the F1 score (by 0.51{\%}), with the author name disambiguation (AND) achieving a F1 score of 98.09{\%}. PKG can trigger broader innovations, not only enabling us to measure scholarly impact, knowledge usage, and knowledge transfer, but also assisting us in profiling authors and organizations based on their connections with bio-entities. The PKG is freely available on Figshare (https://figshare.com/s/6327a55355fc2c99f3a2, simplified version that exclude PubMed raw data) and TACC website (http://er.tacc.utexas.edu/datasets/ped, full version).},

Here, we employ an unsupervised deep learning framework with variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn latent representations of the DNA methylation landscape from three independent breast tumor datasets. Through interrogation of methylation-based learned latent dimension activation values, we demonstrate the feasibility of VAEs to track representative differential methylation patterns among clinical subtypes of tumors. CpGs whose methylation was most correlated VAE latent dimension activation values were significantly enriched for CpG sparse regulatory regions of the genome including enhancer regions. In addition, through comparison with LASSO, we show the utility of the VAE approach for revealing novel information about CpG DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In unsupervised learning and clustering, data integration from different  sources and types is a difficult question discussed in several research areas. For instance in omics analysis, dozen of clustering methods have been developed in the past decade. When a single source of data is at play, hierarchical clustering (HC) is extremely popular, as a tree structure is highly interpretable and arguably more informative than just a partition of the data. However, applying blindly HC to multiple sources of data raises computational and interpretation issues. RESULTS: We propose mergeTrees, a method that aggregates a set of trees with the same leaves to create a consensus tree. In our consensus tree, a cluster at height h contains the individuals that are in the same cluster for all the trees at height h. The method is exact and proven to be [Formula: see text], n being the individuals and q being the number of trees to aggregate. Our implementation is extremely effective on simulations, allowing us to process many large trees at a time. We also rely on mergeTrees to perform the cluster analysis of two real -omics data sets, introducing a spectral variant as an efficient and robust by-product. CONCLUSIONS: Our tree aggregation method can be used in conjunction with hierarchical clustering to perform efficient cluster analysis. This approach was found to be robust to the absence of clustering information in some of the data sets as well as an increased variability within true clusters. The method is implemented in R/C++ and available as an R package named mergeTrees, which makes it easy to integrate in existing or new pipelines in several research areas.},

abstract = {Biofluid-based metabolomics has the potential to provide highly accurate, minimally invasive diagnostics. Metabolomics studies using mass spectrometry typically reduce the high-dimensional data to only a small number of statistically significant features, that are often chemically identified—where each feature corresponds to a mass-to-charge ratio, retention time, and intensity. This practice may remove a substantial amount of predictive signal. To test the utility of the complete feature set, we train machine learning models for health state-prediction in 35 human metabolomics studies, representing 148 individual data sets. Models trained with all features outperform those using only significant features and frequently provide high predictive performance across nine health state categories, despite disparate experimental and disease contexts. Using only non-significant features it is still often possible to train models and achieve high predictive performance, suggesting useful predictive signal. This work highlights the potential for health state diagnostics using all metabolomics features with data-driven analysis.},

abstract = {Protein dynamic properties have been computationally accessible only by means of molecular-dynamic simulations, or network models, of specific molecules. We have developed a bioinformatic approach to dynamics, which makes it possible to delineate the dynamic characteristics of large numbers of sequences simultaneously. In this work we report an analysis of the large-scale dynamic structure of protein space. It is demonstrated that proteins of different structural classes have different dynamic behaviors, and that all-helical proteins occur with two distinct types of dynamic behavior. One subset of helical proteins is characterized by localized, helix-based dynamics, while the complementary subset exhibits dynamics of a more three-dimensional nature. This information has not been available through the application of more traditional methods.

All study data are included in the article.},

Benefiting from the advances of network science and high-throughput biomedical technologies, studying the biological systems from network biology has attracted much attention in recent years, and networks have long been central to our understanding of biological systems, in the form of linkage maps among genotypes, phenotypes, and the corresponding environmental factors. In this review, we summarize the recent developments of computational network biology, first introducing various types of biological networks and network structural properties. We then review the network-based approaches, ranging from some network metrics to the complicated machine-learning methods, and emphasize how to use these algorithms to gain new biological insights. Furthermore, we highlight the application in neuroscience, human disease, and drug developments from the perspectives of network science, and we discuss some major challenges and future directions. We hope that this review will draw increasing interdisciplinary attention from physicists, computer scientists, and biologists.},

Previous studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79{\%} and 96{\%} sequence identity to SARS-CoV and to bat coronavirus RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Furthermore, a series of studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 induces clusters of severe respiratory illnesses (i.e., pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome) resembling SARS-CoV. Moreover, the pathological syndrome may, in part, be caused by cytokine storms and dysregulated immune responses. Thus, in this work the recent literature surrounding the biology, clinical manifestations, and immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is summarized, with the aim of aiding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

In cancer, genetic aberrations have been traditionally thought to disrupt the entire gene function. It has been increasingly appreciated that each mutation of a gene could have a subtle but unique effect on protein function or network rewiring, contributing to diverse phenotypic consequences across cancer patient populations. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of cancer genetic variants, including the broad spectrum of mutation classes and the wide range of mechanistic effects on gene function in the context of signalling networks. We highlight recent advances in computational and experimental strategies to study the diverse functional and phenotypic consequences of mutations at the base-pair resolution. Such information is crucial to understanding the complex pleiotropic effect of cancer genes and provides a possible link between genotype and phenotype in cancer.},

abstract = {Transfer learning, which transfers patterns learned on a source dataset to a related target dataset for constructing prediction models, has been shown effective in many applications. In this paper, we investigate whether transfer learning can be used to improve the performance of anti-cancer drug response prediction models. Previous transfer learning studies for drug response prediction focused on building models to predict the response of tumor cells to a specific drug treatment. We target the more challenging task of building general prediction models that can make predictions for both new tumor cells and new drugs. Uniquely, we investigate the power of transfer learning for three drug response prediction applications including drug repurposing, precision oncology, and new drug development, through different data partition schemes in cross-validation. We extend the classic transfer learning framework through ensemble and demonstrate its general utility with three representative prediction algorithms including a gradient boosting model and two deep neural networks. The ensemble transfer learning framework is tested on benchmark in vitro drug screening datasets. The results demonstrate that our framework broadly improves the prediction performance in all three drug response prediction applications with all three prediction algorithms.},

abstract = {The pandemic caused by emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020, the second pandemic of the twenty-first century. Expanding virus populations, such as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms, imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for robust clustering. Here, we propose subdividing the global SARS-CoV-2 population into six well-defined subtypes and 10 poorly represented genotypes named tentative subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons and structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. The six subtypes and the additional genotypes showed amino acid replacements that might have phenotypic implications. Notably, three mutations (one of them in the Spike protein) were responsible for the geographical segregation of subtypes. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing candidate vaccines or drugs.},

abstract = {We present an integromic analysis of gene alterations that modulate transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$)-Smad-mediated signaling in 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Focusing on genes that encode mediators and regulators of TGF-$\beta$ signaling, we found at least one genomic alteration (mutation, homozygous deletion, or amplification) in 39{\%} of samples, with highest frequencies in gastrointestinal cancers. We identified mutation hotspots in genes that encode TGF-$\beta$ ligands (BMP5), receptors (TGFBR2, AVCR2A, and BMPR2), and Smads (SMAD2 and SMAD4). Alterations in the TGF-$\beta$ superfamily correlated positively with expression of metastasis-associated genes and with decreased survival. Correlation analyses showed the contributions of mutation, amplification, deletion, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression to transcriptional activity of TGF-$\beta$ signaling in each cancer type. This study provides a broad molecular perspective relevant for future functional and therapeutic studies of the diverse cancer pathways mediated by the TGF-$\beta$ superfamily.},

abstract = {Deep learning models have shown great promise in predicting regulatory effects from DNA sequence, but their informativeness for human complex diseases is not fully understood. Here, we evaluate genome-wide SNP annotations from two previous deep learning models, DeepSEA and Basenji, by applying stratified LD score regression to 41 diseases and traits (average N = 320K), conditioning on a broad set of coding, conserved and regulatory annotations. We aggregated annotations across all (respectively blood or brain) tissues/cell-types in meta-analyses across all (respectively 11 blood or 8 brain) traits. The annotations were highly enriched for disease heritability, but produced only limited conditionally significant results: non-tissue-specific and brain-specific Basenji-H3K4me3 for all traits and brain traits respectively. We conclude that deep learning models have yet to achieve their full potential to provide considerable unique information for complex disease, and that their conditional informativeness for disease cannot be inferred from their accuracy in predicting regulatory annotations.},

abstract = {Vectoral and alignment-free approaches to biological sequence representation have been explored in bioinformatics to efficiently handle big data. Even so, most current methods involve sequence comparisons via alignment-based heuristics and fail when applied to the analysis of large data sets. Here, we present “Spaced Words Projection (SWeeP)”, a method for representing biological sequences using relatively small vectors while preserving intersequence comparability. SWeeP uses spaced-words by scanning the sequences and generating indices to create a higher-dimensional vector that is later projected onto a smaller randomly oriented orthonormal base. We constructed phylogenetic trees for all organisms with mitochondrial and bacterial protein data in the NCBI database. SWeeP quickly built complete and accurate trees for these organisms with low computational cost. We compared SWeeP to other alignment-free methods and Sweep was 10 to 100 times quicker than the other techniques. A tool to build SWeeP vectors is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/spacedwordsprojection/.},

abstract = {We conducted the largest investigation of predisposition variants in cancer to date, discovering 853 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 8{\%} of 10,389 cases from 33 cancer types. Twenty-one genes showed single or cross-cancer associations, including novel associations of SDHA in melanoma and PALB2 in stomach adenocarcinoma. The 659 predisposition variants and 18 additional large deletions in tumor suppressors, including ATM, BRCA1, and NF1, showed low gene expression and frequent (43{\%}) loss of heterozygosity or biallelic two-hit events. We also discovered 33 such variants in oncogenes, including missenses in MET, RET, and PTPN11 associated with high gene expression. We nominated 47 additional predisposition variants from prioritized VUSs supported by multiple evidences involving case-control frequency, loss of heterozygosity, expression effect, and co-localization with mutations and modified residues. Our integrative approach links rare predisposition variants to functional consequences, informing future guidelines of variant classification and germline genetic testing in cancer. A pan-cancer analysis identifies hundreds of predisposing germline variants.},

abstract = {Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this observational study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of COVID-19 deaths. We apply a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 152 countries over 108 days (n = 6524). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables and isolate the UVI effect from potential confounding factors. After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p {\textless} 0.01] and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate [p {\textless} 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (− 12{\%}) and CFR (− 38{\%}). We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention would be very attractive.},

In a strategic effort to map the knowledge gaps around proteins encoded by the human genome and to promote the exploration of currently understudied, but potentially druggable, proteins, the US National Institutes of Health launched the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) initiative in 2014. In this article, we discuss how the systematic collection and processing of a wide array of genomic, proteomic, chemical and disease-related resource data by the IDG Knowledge Management Center have enabled the development of evidence-based criteria for tracking the target development level (TDL) of human proteins, which indicates a substantial knowledge deficit for approximately two out of five proteins in the human proteome. We then present spotlights on the TDL categories as well as key drug target classes, including G protein-coupled receptors, protein kinases and ion channels, which illustrate the nature of the unexplored opportunities for biomedical research and therapeutic development.},

New pathways in metabolic networks often evolve by recruiting weak promiscuous activities of pre-existing enzymes. Here we describe recent systems biology advances to map such ‘underground' activities and to predict and analyze their contribution to new metabolic functions. Underground activities are prevalent in cellular metabolism and can form novel pathways that either enable evolutionary adaptation to new environments or provide bypass to genetic lesions. We also illustrate the potential of integrating computational models of underground metabolism and experimental approaches to study the evolution of novel metabolic phenotypes and advance the field of biotechnology.},

abstract = {Non-small-cell lung cancer patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations typically benefit from ﻿EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. However, virtually all patients succumb to acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance that occurs via diverse mechanisms. The diversity and unpredictability of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms presents a challenge for developing new treatments to overcome EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Here, we show that Akt activation is a convergent feature of acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, across a spectrum of diverse, established upstream resistance mechanisms. Combined treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and Akt inhibitor causes apoptosis and synergistic growth inhibition in multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer models. Moreover, phospho-Akt levels are increased in most clinical specimens obtained from EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer patients with acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Our findings provide a rationale for clinical trials testing Akt and EGFR inhibitor co-treatment in patients with elevated phospho-Akt levels to therapeutically combat the heterogeneity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms.EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer are often resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. In this study, the authors show that resistant tumors display high Akt activation and that a combined treatment with AKT inhibitors causes synergistic tumour growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

abstract = {Complex traits and diseases like human height or cancer are often not caused by a single mutation or genetic variant, but instead arise from functional changes in the underlying molecular network. Biological networks are known to be highly modular and contain dense “communities” of genes that carry out cellular processes, but these structures change between tissues, during development, and in disease. While many methods exist for inferring networks and analyzing their topologies separately, there is a lack of robust methods for quantifying differences in network structure. Here, we describe ALPACA (ALtered Partitions Across Community Architectures), a method for comparing two genome-scale networks derived from different phenotypic states to identify condition-specific modules. In simulations, ALPACA leads to more nuanced, sensitive, and robust module discovery than currently available network comparison methods. As an application, we use ALPACA to compare transcriptional networks in three contexts: angiogenic and non-angiogenic subtypes of ovarian cancer, human fibroblasts expressing transforming viral oncogenes, and sexual dimorphism in human breast tissue. In each case, ALPACA identifies modules enriched for processes relevant to the phenotype. For example, modules specific to angiogenic ovarian tumors are enriched for genes associated with blood vessel development, and modules found in female breast tissue are enriched for genes involved in estrogen receptor and ERK signaling. The functional relevance of these new modules suggests that not only can ALPACA identify structural changes in complex networks, but also that these changes may be relevant for characterizing biological phenotypes.},

Coiled-coils are $\alpha$-helical structures responsible for a diverse range of functions, but most importantly, they facilitate the structural organization of macromolecular scaffolds via oligomerization. In this study, we analyzed a comprehensive set of disease-associated germline mutations in coiled-coil structures. Our results suggest an important role of residues near the N-terminal part of coiled-coil regions, possibly critical for superhelix assembly and folding in some cases. We also show that coiled-coils of different oligomerization states exhibit characteristically distinct patterns of disease-causing mutations. Our study provides structural and functional explanations on how disease emerges through the mutation of these structural motifs.},

abstract = {Analyses of large somatic mutation datasets, using advanced computational algorithms, have revealed at least 30 independent mutational signatures in tumor samples. These studies have been instrumental in identification and quantification of responsible endogenous and exogenous molecular processes in cancer. The quantitative approach used to deconvolute mutational signatures is becoming an integral part of cancer research. Therefore, development of a stand-alone tool with a user-friendly graphical interface for analysis of cancer mutational signatures is necessary. In this manuscript, we introduce CANCERSIGN as an open access bioinformatics tool that uses raw mutation data (BED files) as input, and identifies 3-mer and 5-mer mutational signatures. CANCERSIGN enables users to identify signatures within whole genome, whole exome or pooled samples. It can also identify signatures in specific regions of the genome (defined by user). Additionally, this tool enables users to perform clustering on tumor samples based on the raw mutation counts as well as using the proportion of mutational signatures in each sample. Using this tool, we analysed all the whole genome somatic mutation datasets profiled by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and identified a number of novel signatures. By examining signatures found in exonic and non-exonic regions of the genome using WGS and comparing this to signatures found in WES data we observe that WGS can identify additional non-exonic signatures that are enriched in the non-coding regions of the genome while the deeper sequencing of WES may help identify weak signatures that are otherwise missed in shallower WGS data.},

It can be very difficult for a scientist who is not trained in structural bioinformatics to access this information comprehensively. Previously, we developed the Protein Common Interface Database (ProtCID), which provided clusters of the interfaces of full-length protein chains as a means of identifying biological assemblies. Because proteins consist of domains that act as modular functional units, we have extended the analysis in ProtCID to the individual domain level. This has greatly increased the number of large protein-protein clusters in ProtCID, enabling the generation of hypotheses on the structures of biological assemblies of many systems. The analysis of domain families allows us to extend ProtCID to the interactions of domains with peptides, nucleic acids, and ligands. ProtCID provides complete annotations and coordinate sets for every cluster.},

abstract = {The acceleration of DNA sequencing in patients and population samples has resulted in unprecedented catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants discovered using such technologies remains extremely challenging. A striking example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Through manual curation of putative loss of function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative mRNA splicing, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates this exon expression information into variant interpretation. Here, we develop a transcript-level annotation metric, the proportion expressed across transcripts (pext), which summarizes isoform quantifications for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression project2 (GTEx) and show that it clearly differentiates between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.4{\%} of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4{\%} of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental disorders and intellectual disability (DD/ID) to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have effect sizes similar to those of synonymous variants, while pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases versus controls. Our annotation is fast, flexible, and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for rare disease diagnosis, rare variant burden analyses in complex disorders, and curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.},

abstract = {The inheritance modes of pathogenic missense mutations are known to be highly associated with protein structures; recessive mutations are mainly observed in the buried region of protein structures, whereas dominant mutations are significantly enriched in the interfaces of molecular interactions. However, the differences in phenotypic impacts among various dominant mutations observed in individuals are not fully understood. In the present study, the functional effects of pathogenic missense mutations on three-dimensional macromolecular complex structures were explored in terms of dominant mutation types, namely, haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, or toxic gain-of-function. The major types of dominant mutation were significantly associated with the different types of molecular interactions, such as protein-DNA, homo-oligomerization, or intramolecular domain-domain interactions, affected by mutations. The dominant-negative mutations were biased toward molecular interfaces for cognate protein or DNA. The haploinsufficiency mutations were enriched on the DNA interfaces. The gain-of-function mutations were localized to domain-domain interfaces. Our results demonstrate a novel use of macromolecular complex structures for predicting the disease-causing mechanisms through inheritance modes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies enable us to comprehensively identify candidate mutations associated with particular diseases in humans 1 . However, the mechanisms of how the mutations cause the disease are still elusive in many cases. Recent efforts of large cohort projects of whole exome or genome sequencings have revealed that several mutations suggested to be pathogenic were free-riding rare variants and not involved in disease causality 2, 3 . This indicates that we need further evidence, probably based on molecular mechanisms, to convincingly judge the pathogenicity of the genetic variants observed in individuals. Even though a number of studies have been done to predict the functional or structural impacts of missense mutations 4–6 , the predictions of phenotypic impacts through inheritance modes of the missense mutations are not straightforward. Recessive and dominant are the two major inheritance modes of phenotypes caused by mutations. Most of the recessive mutations result in loss-of-function conditions. On the other hand, the cases of dominant mutations are more complicated than recessive ones, and the mutations are categorized by their molec-ular mechanisms: haploinsufficiency (HI), dominant-negative (DN), or gain-of-function (GF, including toxic gain-of-function and constitutive activation) 7},

Building on recent theoretical and empirical work we introduce the concept of adaptive architecture, which extends the genetic architecture of an adaptive trait by factors influencing its adaptive potential and population genetic principles. Because adaptation can be typically achieved by many different combinations of adaptive alleles (redundancy), we describe how two characteristics — heterogeneity among loci and non-parallelism between replicated populations — are hallmarks for the characterization of polygenic adaptation in evolving populations. We discuss how this unified framework can be applied to natural and experimental populations.},

Computational tools offer a promising alternative, helping identify biologically significant, yet unmapped protein-protein interactions (PPIs). While link prediction methods connect proteins on the basis of biological or network-based similarity, interacting proteins are not necessarily similar and similar proteins do not necessarily interact. Here, we offer structural and evolutionary evidence that proteins interact not if they are similar to each other, but if one of them is similar to the other's partners. This approach, that mathematically relies on network paths of length three (L3), significantly outperforms all existing link prediction methods. Given its high accuracy, we show that L3 can offer mechanistic insights into disease mechanisms and can complement future experimental efforts to complete the human interactome.},

abstract = {Motivation: Despite significant efforts in expert curation, clinical relevance about most of the 154 million dbSNP reference variants (RS) remains unknown. However, a wealth of knowledge about the variant biological function/disease impact is buried in unstructured literature data. Previous studies have attempted to harvest and unlock such information with text-mining techniques but are of limited use because their mutation extraction results are not standardized or integrated with curated data. Results: We propose an automatic method to extract and normalize variant mentions to unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). Our method, in benchmarking results, demonstrates a high F-measure of similar to 90{\%} and compared favorably to the state of the art. Next, we applied our approach to the entire PubMed and validated the results by verifying that each extracted variant-gene pair matched the dbSNP annotation based on mapped genomic position, and by analyzing variants curated in ClinVar. We then determined which text-mined variants and genes constituted novel discoveries. Our analysis reveals 41 889 RS numbers (associated with 9151 genes) not found in ClinVar. Moreover, we obtained a rich set worth further review: 12 462 rare variants (MAF {\textless}= 0.01) in 3849 genes which are presumed to be deleterious and not frequently found in the general population. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to analyze and integrate text-mined variant data with curated knowledge in existing databases. Our results suggest that databases can be significantly enriched by text mining and that the combined information can greatly assist human efforts in evaluating/prioritizing variants in genomic research.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Properly scoring protein-protein docking models to single out the correct ones is an open challenge, also object of assessment in CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions), a community-wide blind docking experiment. We introduced in the field CONSRANK (CONSensus RANKing), the first pure consensus method. Also available as a web server, CONSRANK ranks docking models in an ensemble based on their ability to match the most frequent inter-residue contacts in it. We have been blindly testing CONSRANK in all the latest CAPRI rounds, where we showed it to perform competitively with the state-of-the-art energy and knowledge-based scoring functions. More recently, we developed Clust-CONSRANK, an algorithm introducing a contact-based clustering of the models as a preliminary step of the CONSRANK scoring process. In the latest CASP13-CAPRI joint experiment, we participated as scorers with a novel pipeline, combining both our scoring tools, CONSRANK and Clust-CONSRANK, with our interface analysis tool COCOMAPS. Selection of the 10 models for submission was guided by the strength of the emerging consensus, and their final ranking was assisted by results of the interface analysis. RESULTS: As a result of the above approach, we were by far the first scorer in the CASP13-CAPRI top-1 ranking, having high/medium quality models ranked at the top-1 position for the majority of targets (11 out of the total 19). We were also the first scorer in the top-10 ranking, on a par with another group, and the second scorer in the top-5 ranking. Further, we topped the ranking relative to the prediction of binding interfaces, among all the scorers and predictors. Using the CASP13-CAPRI targets as case studies, we illustrate here in detail the approach we adopted. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing some flexibility in the final model selection and ranking, as well as differentiating the adopted scoring approach depending on the targets were the key assets for our highly successful performance, as compared to previous CAPRI rounds. The approach we propose is entirely based on methods made available to the community and could thus be reproduced by any user.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs play a vital role in biological processes and are closely related to various human diseases. Research on miRNA-disease associations is helpful not only for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, but also for new drug identification and lead compound discovery. A novel sequence- and symptom-based random forest algorithm model (Seq-SymRF) was developed to identify potential associations between miRNA and disease. Features derived from sequence information and clinical symptoms were utilized to characterize miRNA and disease, respectively. Moreover, the clustering method by calculating the Euclidean distance was adopted to construct reliable negative samples. Based on the fivefold cross-validation, Seq-SymRF achieved the accuracy of 98.00{\%}, specificity of 99.43{\%}, sensitivity of 96.58{\%}, precision of 99.40{\%} and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9604, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve were 0.9967 and 0.9975, respectively. Additionally, case studies were implemented with leukemia, breast neoplasms and hsa-mir-21. Most of the top-25 predicted disease-related miRNAs (19/25 for leukemia; 20/25 for breast neoplasms) and 15 of top-25 predicted miRNA-related diseases were verified by literature and dbDEMC database. It is anticipated that Seq-SymRF could be regarded as a powerful high-throughput virtual screening tool for drug research and development.

abstract = {The increasing interest in bioactive peptides with therapeutic potentials has been reflected in a large variety of biological databases published over the last years. However, the knowledge discovery process from these heterogeneous data sources is a nontrivial task, becoming the essence of our research endeavor. Therefore, we devise a unified data model based on molecular similarity networks for representing a chemical reference space of bioactive peptides, having an implicit knowledge that is currently not explicitly accessed in existing biological databases. Indeed, our main contribution is a novel workflow for the automatic construction of such similarity networks, enabling visual graph mining techniques to uncover new insights from the “ocean” of known bioactive peptides. The workflow presented here relies on the following sequential steps: (i) calculation of molecular descriptors by applying statistical and aggregation operators on amino acid property vectors; (ii) a two-stage unsupervised feature selection method to identify an optimized subset of descriptors using the concepts of entropy and mutual information; (iii) generation of sparse networks where nodes represent bioactive peptides, and edges between two nodes denote their pairwise similarity/distance relationships in the defined descriptor space; and (iv) exploratory analysis using visual inspection in combination with clustering and network science techniques. For practical purposes, the proposed workflow has been implemented in our visual analytics software tool (http://mobiosd-hub.com/starpep/), to assist researchers in extracting useful information from an integrated collection of 45120 bioactive peptides, which is one of the largest and most diverse data in its field. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed workflow for discovering central nodes in molecular similarity networks that may represent a biologically relevant chemical space known to date.},

abstract = {Proteins interact with other macromolecules in complex cellular networks for signal transduction and biological function. In cancer, genetic aberrations have been traditionally thought to disrupt the entire gene function. It has been increasingly appreciated that each mutation of a gene could have a subtle but unique effect on protein function or network rewiring, contributing to diverse phenotypic consequences across cancer patient populations. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of cancer genetic variants, including the broad spectrum of mutation classes and the wide range of mechanistic effects on gene function in the context of signalling networks. We highlight recent advances in computational and experimental strategies to study the diverse functional and phenotypic consequences of mutations at the base-pair resolution. Such information is crucial to understanding the complex pleiotropic effect of cancer genes and provides a possible link between genotype and phenotype in cancer.},

abstract = {Correlation networks are commonly used to statistically extract biological interactions between omics markers. Network edge selection is typically based on the significance of the underlying correlation coefficients. A statistical cutoff, however, is not guaranteed to capture biological reality, and heavily depends on dataset properties such as sample size. We here propose an alternative, innovative approach to address the problem of network reconstruction. Specifically, we developed a cutoff selection algorithm that maximizes the agreement to a given ground truth. We first evaluate the approach on IgG glycomics data, for which the biochemical pathway is known and well-characterized. The optimal network outperforms networks obtained with statistical cutoffs and is robust with respect to sample size. Importantly, we can show that even in the case of incomplete or incorrect prior knowledge, the optimal network is close to the true optimum. We then demonstrate the generalizability of the approach on an untargeted metabolomics and a transcriptomics dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For the transcriptomics case, we demonstrate that the optimized network is superior to statistical networks in systematically retrieving interactions that were not included in the biological reference used for the optimization. Overall, this paper shows that using prior information for correlation network inference is superior to using regular statistical cutoffs, even if the prior information is incomplete or partially inaccurate.},

However, even fundamental aspects relating to which human proteins exist, where they are expressed and in which quantities are not fully understood. Therefore, we have generated a systematic, quantitative and deep proteome and transcriptome abundance atlas from 29 paired healthy human tissues from the Human Protein Atlas Project and representing human genes by 17,615 transcripts and 13,664 proteins. The analysis revealed that few proteins show truly tissue-specific expression, that vast differences between mRNA and protein quantities within and across tissues exist and that the expression levels of proteins are often more stable across tissues than those of transcripts. In addition, only {\~{}}2{\%} of all exome and {\~{}}7{\%} of all mRNA variants could be confidently detected at the protein level showing that proteogenomics remains challenging, requires rigorous validation using synthetic peptides and needs more sophisticated computational methods. Many uses of this resource can be envisaged ranging from the study of gene/protein expression regulation to protein biomarker specificity evaluation to name a few.},

abstract = {Identifying molecular cancer drivers is critical for precision oncology. Multiple advanced algorithms to identify drivers now exist, but systematic attempts to combine and optimize them on large datasets are few. We report a PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis spanning 9,423 tumor exomes (comprising all 33 of The Cancer Genome Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools to catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify 299 driver genes with implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequence- and structure-based analyses identified {\textgreater}3,400 putative missense driver mutations supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation confirmed 60{\%}–85{\%} of predicted mutations as likely drivers. We found that {\textgreater}300 MSI tumors are associated with high PD-1/PD-L1, and 57{\%} of tumors analyzed harbor putative clinically actionable events. Our study represents the most comprehensive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to date and will serve as a blueprint for future biological and clinical endeavors. A comprehensive analysis of oncogenic driver genes and mutations in {\textgreater}9,000 tumors across 33 cancer types highlights the prevalence of clinically actionable cancer driver events in TCGA tumor samples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The selection and prioritization of drug targets is a central problem in  drug discovery. Computational approaches can leverage the growing number of large-scale human genomics and proteomics data to make in-silico target identification, reducing the cost and the time needed. RESULTS: We developed a machine learning approach to score proteins to generate a druggability score of novel targets. In our model we incorporated 70 protein features which included properties derived from the sequence, features characterizing protein functions as well as network properties derived from the protein-protein interaction network. The advantage of this approach is that it is unbiased and even less studied proteins with limited information about their function can score well as most of the features are independent of the accumulated literature. We build models on a training set which consist of targets with approved drugs and a negative set of non-drug targets. The machine learning techniques help to identify the most important combination of features differentiating validated targets from non-targets. We validated our predictions on an independent set of clinical trial drug targets, achieving a high accuracy characterized by an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Our most predictive features included biological function of proteins, network centrality measures, protein essentiality, tissue specificity, localization and solvent accessibility. Our predictions, based on a small set of 102 validated oncology targets, recovered the majority of known drug targets and identifies a novel set of proteins as drug target candidates. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine learning approach to prioritize proteins according to their similarity to approved drug targets. We have shown that the method proposed is highly predictive on a validation dataset consisting of 277 targets of clinical trial drug confirming that our computational approach is an efficient and cost-effective tool for drug target discovery and prioritization. Our predictions were based on oncology targets and cancer relevant biological functions, resulting in significantly higher scores for targets of oncology clinical trial drugs compared to the scores of targets of trial drugs for other indications. Our approach can be used to make indication specific drug-target prediction by combining generic druggability features with indication specific biological functions.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are crucial components of the cell, they are highly abundant and participate ubiquitously in a wide range of biological functions, such as regulatory processes and cell signaling. Many of their important functions rely on protein interactions, by which they trigger or modulate different pathways. Sequence covariation, a powerful tool for protein contact prediction, has been applied successfully to predict protein structure and to identify protein–protein interactions mostly of globular proteins. IDPs/IDRs also mediate a plethora of protein–protein interactions, highlighting the importance of addressing sequence covariation-based inter-protein contact prediction of this class of proteins. Despite their importance, a systematic approach to analyze the covariation phenomena of intrinsically disordered proteins and their complexes is still missing. Here we carry out a comprehensive critical assessment of coevolution-based contact prediction in IDP/IDR complexes and detail the challenges and possible limitations that emerge from their analysis. We found that the coevolutionary signal is faint in most of the complexes of disordered proteins but positively correlates with the interface size and binding affinity between partners. In addition, we discuss the state-of-art methodology by biological interpretation of the results, formulate evaluation guidelines and suggest future directions of development to the field.},

abstract = {Every cancer originates from a single cell. During expansion of the neoplastic cell population, individual cells acquire genetic and phenotypic differences from each other. Here, to investigate the nature and extent of intra-tumour diversification, we characterized organoids derived from multiple single cells from three colorectal cancers as well as from adjacent normal intestinal crypts. Colorectal cancer cells showed extensive mutational diversification and carried several times more somatic mutations than normal colorectal cells. Most mutations were acquired during the final dominant clonal expansion of the cancer and resulted from mutational processes that are absent from normal colorectal cells. Intra-tumour diversification of DNA methylation and transcriptome states also occurred; these alterations were cell-autonomous, stable, and followed the phylogenetic tree of each cancer. There were marked differences in responses to anticancer drugs between even closely related cells of the same tumour. The results indicate that colorectal cancer cells experience substantial increases in somatic mutation rate compared to normal colorectal cells, and that genetic diversification of each cancer is accompanied by pervasive, stable and inherited differences in the biological states of individual cancer cells.},

abstract = {{\textless}p id="p-6"{\textgreater}How mutation and selection determine the fitness landscape of tumors and hence clinical outcome is an open fundamental question in cancer biology, crucial for the assessment of therapeutic strategies and resistance to treatment. Here we explore the mutation-selection phase diagram of 6,721 tumors representing 23 cancer types by quantifying the overall somatic point mutation load (ML) and selection (dN/dS) in the entire proteome of each tumor. We show that ML strongly correlates with patient survival, revealing two opposing regimes around a critical point. In low-ML cancers, a high number of mutations indicates poor prognosis, whereas high-ML cancers show the opposite trend, presumably due to mutational meltdown. Although the majority of cancers evolve near neutrality, deviations are observed at extreme MLs. Melanoma, with the highest ML, evolves under purifying selection, whereas in low-ML cancers, signatures of positive selection are observed, demonstrating how selection affects tumor fitness. Moreover, different cancers occupy specific positions on the ML–dN/dS plane, revealing a diversity of evolutionary trajectories. These results support and expand the theory of tumor evolution and its nonlinear effects on survival.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Grigas2020,
abstract = {The ability to consistently distinguish real protein structures from computationally generated model decoys is not yet a solved problem. One route to distinguish real protein structures from decoys is to delineate the important physical features that specify a real protein. For example, it has long been appreciated that the hydrophobic cores of proteins contribute significantly to their stability. We used two sources to obtain datasets of decoys to compare with real protein structures: submissions to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction competition, in which researchers attempt to predict the structure of a protein only knowing its amino acid sequence, and also decoys generated by 3DRobot, which have user-specified global root-mean-squared deviations from experimentally determined structures. Our analysis revealed that both sets of decoys possess cores that do not recapitulate the key features that define real protein cores. In particular, the model structures appear more densely packed (because of energetically unfavorable atomic overlaps), contain too few residues in the core, and have improper distributions of hydrophobic residues throughout the structure. Based on these observations, we developed a feed-forward neural network, which incorporates key physical features of protein cores, to predict how well a computational model recapitulates the real protein structure without knowledge of the structure of the target sequence. By identifying the important features of protein structure, our method is able to rank decoy structures with similar accuracy to that obtained by state-of-the-art methods that incorporate many additional features. The small number of physical features makes our model interpretable, emphasizing the importance of protein packing and hydrophobicity in protein structure prediction.},

Structure determination usually relies on physical techniques including x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Here we present a method that allows the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a biological macromolecule to be determined only from measurements of the activity of mutant variants of the molecule. This genetic approach to structure determination relies on the quantification of genetic interactions (epistasis) between mutations and should be widely applicable, including to macromolecules whose structures are difficult to determine by physical techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Faced with the global pandemic of COVID-19, declared by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020, and the need to better understand the seasonal behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its connection with different weather factors such as temperature and relative humidity. METHODS: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, two studies had a high risk of bias, eleven studies were scored as moderate risk of bias, and four studies were classified as low risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. CONCLUSION: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, these variables alone could not explain most of the variability in disease transmission. Therefore, the countries most affected by the disease should focus on health policies, even with climates less favorable to the virus. Although the certainty of the evidence generated was classified as low, there was homogeneity between the results reported by the included studies.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes, each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature1. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium2 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we characterized mutational signatures using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole-genome and 19,184 exome sequences that encompass most types of cancer. We identified 49 single-base-substitution, 11 doublet-base-substitution, 4 clustered-base-substitution and 17 small insertion-and-deletion signatures. The substantial size of our dataset, compared with previous analyses3-15, enabled the discovery of new signatures, the separation of overlapping signatures and the decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated-but distinct-DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. By estimating the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes, we revealed associations of signatures to exogenous or endogenous exposures, as well as to defective DNA-maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a systematic perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes that contribute to the development of human cancer.},

Here we build and analyze the multiplex network of 779 human diseases, which consists of a genotype-based layer and a phenotype-based layer. We show that diseases with common genetic constituents tend to share symptoms, and uncover how phenotype information helps boost genotype information. Moreover, we offer a flexible classification of diseases that considers their molecular underpinnings alongside their clinical manifestations. We detect cohesive groups of diseases that have high intra-group similarity at both the molecular and the phenotypic level. Inspecting these disease classes, we demonstrate the underlying pathways that connect diseases mechanistically. We observe monogenic disorders grouped together with complex diseases for which they increase the risk factor. We propose potentially new disease associations that arise as a unique feature of the information flow within and across the two layers.},

abstract = {Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is the prototype of autoimmune diseases, characterized by extensive gene expression perturbations in peripheral blood immune cells. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these perturbations may be due to altered epigenetic profiles and chromatin accessibility but the relationship between transcriptional deregulation and genome organization remains largely unstudied. In this work we propose a genomic approach that leverages patterns of gene coexpression from genome-wide transcriptome profiles in order to identify statistically robust Domains of Co-ordinated gene Expression (DCEs). Application of this method on a large transcriptome profiling dataset of 148 SLE patients and 52 healthy individuals enabled the identification of significant disease-associated alterations in gene co-regulation patterns, which also correlate with SLE activity status. Low disease activity patient genomes are characterized by extensive fragmentation leading to overall fewer DCEs of smaller size. High disease activity genomes display extensive redistribution of co-expression domains with expanded and newly-appearing (emerged) DCEs. The dynamics of domain fragmentation and redistribution are associated with SLE clinical endophenotypes, with genes of the interferon pathway being highly enriched in DCEs that become disrupted and with functions associated to more generalized symptoms, being located in domains that emerge anew in high disease activity genomes. Our results suggest strong links between the SLE phenotype and the underlying genome structure and underline an important role for genome organization in shaping gene expression in SLE.},

Despite the recent progresses elicited by improved inter-residue contact prediction, contact-based structure prediction has gradually reached the performance ceiling. New methods have been proposed to predict the inter-residue distance, but unanimously by simplifying the real-valued distance prediction into a multiclass classification problem. Here, a lightweight regression-based distance prediction method is shown, which adopts the generative adversarial network to capture the delicate geometric relationship between residue pairs and thus could predict the continuous, real-valued inter-residue distance rapidly and satisfactorily. The predicted residue distance map allows quick structure modeling by the CNS suite, and the constructed models approach the same level of quality as the other state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods when tested on CASP13 targets. Moreover, this method can be used directly for the structure prediction of membrane proteins without transfer learning.},

This cooperation cannot be explained simply as the collective action of cells for the benefit of the tumour because non-cooperative subclones can constantly invade and free-ride on the diffusible factors produced by the cooperative cells. A full understanding of cooperation among the cells of a tumour requires methods and concepts from evolutionary game theory, which has been used successfully in other areas of biology to understand similar problems but has been underutilized in cancer research. Game theory can provide insights into the stability of cooperation among cells in a tumour and into the design of potentially evolution-proof therapies that disrupt this cooperation.},

We first validate Core{\&}Peel for the general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner, and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core{\&}Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover, for the two cancer datasets, Core{\&}Peel detects further eight relevant pathways not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally, we apply Core{\&}Peel and other methods to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts at a pre-clinical level.},

We hypothesize that proteins participating in similar interactions may share common fingerprints, independent of their evolutionary history. Fingerprints may be difficult to grasp by visual analysis but could be learned from large-scale datasets. We present MaSIF (molecular surface interaction fingerprinting), a conceptual framework based on a geometric deep learning method to capture fingerprints that are important for specific biomolecular interactions.

Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p {\textless} 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in Caenorhabditis elegans.},

abstract = {The emergence of the novel SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic of severe pneumonia-like disease designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. The development of a vaccine is likely to require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a novel antiviral therapeutic can exceed 10 years. Thus, repurposing of known drugs could significantly accelerate the deployment of novel therapies for COVID-19. Towards this end, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. We report the identification of 100 molecules that inhibit viral replication, including 21 known drugs that exhibit dose response relationships. Of these, thirteen were found to harbor effective concentrations likely commensurate with achievable therapeutic doses in patients, including the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod2–4, and the cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334, and apilimod were found to antagonize viral replication in human iPSC-derived pneumocyte-like cells, and the PIKfyve inhibitor also demonstrated antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model. Since most of the molecules identified in this study have already advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will enable accelerated preclinical and clinical evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.},

Second, we quantify differential selection between well-known alternative driver mutations, including differences in selection between distinct mutant residues in the same gene.

abstract = {The identification of interactions between drugs/compounds and their targets is crucial for the development of new drugs. In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as 'virtual screening' (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and bench-marking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions.

SUMMARY Current machine learning techniques enable robust association of biological signals with measured phenotypes , but these approaches are incapable of identifying causal relationships. Here, we develop an integrated ''white-box'' biochemical screening, network modeling, and machine learning approach for revealing causal mechanisms and apply this approach to understanding antibiotic efficacy. We counter-screen diverse metabolites against bacteri-cidal antibiotics in Escherichia coli and simulate their corresponding metabolic states using a genome-scale metabolic network model. Regression of the measured screening data on model simulations reveals that purine biosynthesis participates in antibiotic lethality, which we validate experimentally. We show that antibiotic-induced adenine limitation increases ATP demand, which elevates central carbon metabolism activity and oxygen consumption, enhancing the killing effects of antibiotics. This work demonstrates how prospective network modeling can couple with machine learning to identify complex causal mechanisms underlying drug efficacy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are typically visualized using a  two-dimensional Manhattan plot, displaying chromosomal location of SNPs along the x-axis and the negative log-10 of their p-value on the y-axis. This traditional plot provides a broad overview of the results, but offers little opportunity for interaction or expansion of specific regions, and is unable to show additional dimensions of the dataset. RESULTS: We created BigTop, a visualization framework in virtual reality (VR), designed to render a Manhattan plot in three dimensions, wrapping the graph around the user in a simulated cylindrical room. BigTop uses the z-axis to display minor allele frequency of each SNP, allowing for the identification of allelic variants of genes. BigTop also offers additional interactivity, allowing users to select any individual SNP and receive expanded information, including SNP name, exact values, and gene location, if applicable. BigTop is built in JavaScript using the React and A-Frame frameworks, and can be rendered using commercially available VR headsets or in a two-dimensional web browser such as Google Chrome. Data is read into BigTop in JSON format, and can be provided as either JSON or a tab-separated text file. CONCLUSIONS: Using additional dimensions and interactivity options offered through VR, we provide a new, interactive, three-dimensional representation of the traditional Manhattan plot for displaying and exploring GWAS data.},

abstract = {Finding homologous proteins is the indispensable first step in many protein biology studies. Thus, building highly efficient "search engines" for protein databases is a highly desired function in protein bioinformatics. As of August 2018, there are more than 140,000 protein structures in PDB, and this number is still increasing rapidly. Such a big number introduces a big challenge for scanning the whole structure database with high speeds and high sensitivities at the same time. Unfortunately, classic sequence alignment tools and pairwise structure alignment tools are either not sensitive enough to remote homologous proteins (with low sequence identities) or not fast enough for the task. Therefore, specifically designed computational methods are required for quickly scanning structure databases for homologous proteins. Here, we propose a novel ContactLib-DNN method to quickly scan structure databases for homologous proteins. The core idea is to build structure fingerprints for proteins, and to perform alignment-free comparisons with the fingerprints. Specifically, the fingerprints are low-dimensional vectors representing the contact groups within the proteins. Notably, the Cartesian distance between two fingerprint vectors well matches the RMSD between the two corresponding contact groups. This is done by using RMSD as the domain knowledge to supervise the deep neural network learning. When comparing to existing methods, ContactLib-DNN achieves the highest average AUROC of 0.959. Moreover, the best candidate found by ContactLib-DNN has a probability of 70.0{\%} to be a true positive. This is a significant improvement over 56.2{\%}, the best result produced by existing methods.},

abstract = {Computation-based drug-repurposing/repositioning approaches can greatly speed up the traditional drug discovery process. To date, systematic and comprehensive computation-based approaches to identify and validate drug-repositioning candidates for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have not been undertaken. Here, we present a novel drug discovery strategy that combines a computational drug-repositioning system (DrugPredict) with biological testing in cell lines in order to rapidly identify novel drug candidates for EOC. DrugPredict exploited unique repositioning opportunities rendered by a vast amount of disease genomics, phenomics, drug treatment, and genetic pathway and uniquely revealed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) rank just as high as currently used ovarian cancer drugs. As epidemiological studies have reported decreased incidence of ovarian cancer associated with regular intake of NSAIDs, we assessed whether NSAIDs could have chemoadjuvant applications in EOC and found that (i) NSAID Indomethacin induces robust cell death in primary patient-derived platinum-sensitive and platinum- resistant ovarian cancer cells and ovarian cancer stem cells and (ii) downregulation of $\beta$-catenin is partially driving effects of Indomethacin in cisplatin-resistant cells. In summary, we demonstrate that DrugPredict represents an innovative computational drug- discovery strategy to uncover drugs that are routinely used for other indications that could be effective in treating various cancers, thus introducing a potentially rapid and cost-effective translational opportunity. As NSAIDs are already in routine use in gynecological treatment regimens and have acceptable safety profile, our results will provide with a rationale for testing NSAIDs as potential chemoadjuvants in EOC patient trials.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 October 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.328.},

Here we propose a network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations for specific diseases. By quantifying the network-based relationship between drug targets and disease proteins in the human protein-protein interactome, we show the existence of six distinct classes of drug-drug-disease combinations. Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, we find that only one of the six classes correlates with therapeutic effects: if the targets of the drugs both hit disease module, but target separate neighborhoods. This finding allows us to identify and validate antihypertensive combinations, offering a generic, powerful network methodology to identify efficacious combination therapies in drug development.

At the time of final follow-up, standard radiographs were made and all patients were examined by a physical therapist and either a fellowship-trained shoulder surgeon or an orthopaedic traumatologist. In addition, each patient responded to three different validated objective functional outcome measures: the Short Form-36, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Scale, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire. Isokinetic strength-testing was performed, and strength in internal and external rotation was compared with that of the uninvolved shoulder. The main outcome measures included fracture-healing, functional outcome, patient satisfaction, and muscular strength.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:With regard to range of motion, only the amount of forward flexion was found to be significantly greater in the operatively treated group (p = 0.03). The operatively treated shoulders were found to be weaker in external rotation at 300 degrees /sec and weaker in internal rotation at 180 degrees /sec. When normalized to hand dominance, however, the numbers were too small to identify any significant difference. There was no significant difference between groups with regard to the three functional outcome measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:Good results may be seen both with and without operative treatment. Therefore, we cannot universally recommend operative treatment for a double disruption of the superior suspensory shoulder complex. Treatment must be individualized for each patient.},

Among the available interactome mapping methods, co-elution stands out as a method that is simultaneous in nature and capable of identifying interactions between all the proteins detected in a sample. The general workflow in co-elution methods involves the mild extraction of protein complexes and their separation into several fractions, across which proteins bound together in the same complex will show similar co-elution profiles when analyzed appropriately. In this review we discuss the different separation, quantification and bioinformatic strategies used in co-elution studies, and the important considerations in designing these studies. The benefits of co-elution versus other methods makes it a valuable starting point when asking questions that involve the perturbation of the interactome.},

abstract = {Cancer genomes contain large numbers of somatic mutations but few of these mutations drive tumor development. Current approaches either identify driver genes on the basis of mutational recurrence or approximate the functional consequences of nonsynonymous mutations by using bioinformatic scores. Passenger mutations are enriched in characteristic nucleotide con- texts, whereas driver mutations occur in functional positions, which are not necessarily surrounded by a particular nucleotide context. We observed that mutations in contexts that deviate from the characteristic contexts around passenger mutations pro- vide a signal in favor of driver genes. We therefore developed a method that combines this feature with the signals traditionally used for driver-gene identification. We applied our method to whole-exome sequencing data from 11,873 tumor–normal pairs and identified 460 driver genes that clustered into 21 cancer-related pathways. Our study provides a resource of driver genes across 28 tumor types with additional driver genes identified according to mutations in unusual nucleotide contexts.},

Current computational tools mostly rely on evolutionary conservation and have been calibrated on variants associated with disease, which poses conceptual problems for assessment of variants in poorly conserved pharmacogenes. Here, we evaluated the performance of 18 current functionality prediction methods leveraging experimental high-quality activity data from 337 variants in genes involved in drug metabolism and transport and found that these models only achieved probabilities of 0.1–50.6{\%} to make informed conclusions. We therefore developed a functionality prediction framework optimized for pharmacogenetic assessments that significantly outperformed current algorithms. Our model achieved 93{\%} for both sensitivity and specificity for both loss-of-function and functionally neutral variants, and we confirmed its superior performance using cross validation analyses. This novel model holds promise to improve the translation of personal genetic information into biological conclusions and pharmacogenetic recommendations, thereby facilitating the implementation of Next-Generation Sequencing data into clinical diagnostics.},

abstract = {Cancer genome sequencing has shown that driver genes can often be distinguished not only by the elevated mutation frequency but also by specific nucleotide positions that accumulate changes at a high rate. However, properties associated with a residue's potential to drive tumorigenesis when mutated have not yet been systematically investigated. Here, using a novel methodological approach, we identify and characterize a compendium of 180 hotspot residues within 160 human proteins which occur with a significant frequency and are likely to have functionally relevant impact. We find that such mutations (i) are more prominent in proteins that can exist in the on and off state, (ii) reflect the identity of a tumor of origin, and (iii) often localize within interfaces which mediate interactions with other proteins or ligands. Following, we further examine structural data for human protein complexes and identify a number of additional protein interfaces that accumulate cancer mutations at a high rate. Jointly, these analyses suggest that disruption and dysregulation of protein interactions can be instrumental in switching functions of cancer proteins and activating downstream changes.},
